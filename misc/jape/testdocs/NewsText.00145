   Convicted Liverpool drugs baron Stephen Mee was remanded in custody by a Dutch court today after his lawyer challenged the legality of British methods of gathering evidence.
   Judges in The Hague ordered a British Customs officer to be called as a witness when the major drug-smuggling case resumes on June 5.
   Mee's lawyer said afterwards that his client could be freed if the court finds British criminal intelligence methods incompatible with Dutch law.
   But Mee, 38, is unlikely to return to Britain if he is freed -- he has been on the run for more than three years after being convicted in another drug-smuggling trial.
   Mee, described as one of Europe's most wanted drugs barons, staged a spectacular escape from a prison van as he was being taken to Manchester Crown Court for sentence.
   He was given a 22-year jail term in his absence for his part in a  1 million Colombian drugs racket involving the smuggling of cocaine into Britain.
   Now he is accused of being part of a massive drugs ring intent on flooding Britain with heroin, hashish, cocaine and ecstasy.
   The same Dutch court was told yesterday that another Liverpuddlian, 33-year-old Curtis Warren, was the alleged ringleader of the gang.
   Mee, Warren and six others were arrested in Holland late last year after a joint Anglo-Dutch police and Customs operation led to a raid on cargo from a Venezuelan container ship which docked in Rotterdam.
   The haul included cocaine worth  75 million. Other drugs, worth  25 million, plus weapons and hand grenades, seized in follow-up raids in Rotterdam and Amsterdam.
 But now lawyers are challenging the right of the Dutch court to accept evidence gathered on the basis of British intelligence techniques.
   With rules on disclosure differing in Britain and Holland, the defence argues that the drugs case should be thrown out unless British authorities give details of their information sources, wire taps and other methods which led to the Rotterdam raid.
   Mee appeared in court for 30 minutes today while his lawyer Jan Schoneveld told the three judges that the joint police and Customs drugs raid was the result of evidence supplied by a British liaison officer in a fax.
   He said the court had to be told what events led up to the fax being sent.
   Presiding judge Irene De Vries order HM Customs officer Nick Baker to attend court on June 5 to give details of what led up to the cross-border drugs operation.
   Mr Baker has already been called to appear as part of the resumed case against Mr Warren, also being held on June 5.
   Outside court, Mee's lawyer said: "The problem is that there are questions about the evidence and whether it is legal. It relates to the fax from the English liaison officer which started the investigation in Holland.
   "The Dutch court must be able to see the methods the police and Customs have used.
   "The events leading up to the sending of the fax are not clear. There is a possibility that the way that evidence was gathered is not legal in Holland.
   "If it is decided that the evidence was not properly gathered under Dutch law, then Mee will be going home."
   But home for Mee would have to be somewhere on the Continent -- unless he wants to spend the next 22 years in a British jail.

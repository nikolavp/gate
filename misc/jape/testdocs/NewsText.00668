    RABAT, Morocco (Reuter) - Morocco arrested more than 18,000 people for drug
trafficking, including 315 Europeans, and seized more than 100 tons of canabis
and other hard drugs last year, the interior ministry said Wednesday.
     In a 40-page report, the ministry said: "The undergoing government policy
to combat drug sumggling led to positive results and to arrests of 18,794 people
involved in drug trafficking."
     Among those arrested were 342 foreigners including 315 Europeans.
     The report said the authorities had drawn up a draft law which would
increase the penalty for drug trafficking to up to 30 years in jail and fines to
up to $86,000.

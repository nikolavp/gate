   Richard C. Bartlett was named to the newly created
position of vice chairman of Mary Kay Corp., a privately held
cosmetics company.
</p>
<p>
   Mr. Bartlett was previously president and chief operating officer
of Mary Kay Cosmetics Inc., the company's operating subsidiary.
Those positions won't be filled. Instead, Larry E. Harley,
previously executive vice president of U.S. operations for the
cosmetics unit, was named to the newly created post of president of
U.S. operations, and along with the head of international
operations, will report directly to John P. Rochon, chief executive
officer of the parent company.
</p>
<p>
   A spokesman for the company said Mr. Bartlett's promotion
reflects the current emphasis at Mary Kay on international
expansion. Mr. Bartlett will be involved in developing the
international expansion strategy, he said.

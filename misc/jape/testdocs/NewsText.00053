03Apr97 POLAND:  MONEY-LAUNDERING AND ORGANISED CRIME - A MOUNTING PROBLEM.
Police experts estimate that organised crime is thriving throughout the world, and Poland is no exception. Money-laundering remains the mafia's number one source of income, which means its increasing presence on the capital market, in finances and banking, and some specialists believe that Poland has recently become one of Europe's leading money-laundering centres. In a Zycie Gospodarcze special report compiled on the basis of police statistics and expert analyses, criminologist Jerzy W. Wojcik examined the implications of a more marked presence of organised crime in Poland along with the chief sources of illegal incomes.
The problem of illegal incomes in Poland is closely connected with the second economy as well as rising crime statistics. A steady rise has been noted in violent common crimes, economic offences and organised crime, while detection is impeded by the increasingly professional nature of crime. Consequently, organised crime is growing stronger, expanding its international contacts, and this in turn will boost petty crimes, which will more and more frequently be committed by professionals as well. @BTCENTRE = Crime Categories
Criminal offenders are highly professional and function in organised groups characterised by determination and ruthlessness. In mid-90's, organised gangs centred first and foremost on the following categories of crime:
*production, trafficking and distribution of drugs, both manufactured locally and smuggled from the Golden Triangle, with over 40 such groups uncovered;
*smuggling and illegal sale of weapons (over 20 groups);
 
*contract murders, kidnappings, assault and battery. From among 1,134 murders committed in 1995, as many as 50 were attributed to feuding gangs and some were committed by hired assassins. Over the past years, the police has been able to gather sufficient evidence to bring offenders to justice in the case of just six contract murders and 24 kidnappings attributed to feuding gangs, while as many as 20 organised groups are believed to be coercing payments in return for "protection;"
*raids on travellers, with 2,009 car passengers falling victim in 656 such attacks in 1994. In 161 cases, the assailants threatened to use firearms, and they spoke Russian on 412 occasions;
*production of explosives and use thereof in battles between gangs, with 122 such explosions noted in 1994. Their number has been rising steadily since then, and those responsible are rarely found;
*contraband (liquor, tobacco products), organised and controlled expropriation of property in various sectors, large-scale fraud and tax evasion (excise taxes, VAT), with 60 such groups uncovered in 1994;
*hiring "avengers" to intimidate judges and prosecutors investigating economic gangs;
*car theft and smuggling, with 20 such gangs busted in 1994;
 
*forgery and distribution of forged bills, securities and bank documents;
*smuggling works of art;
*smuggling radioactive substances;
*illegal transfer of foreigners from the East to European Union countries.
In 1995, crime statistics rose by 7.8 percent (from 906,000 incidents in 1994 to a total of 975,000), including a 7 percent increase in criminal offences, although the rise was much steeper in the case of some violent crimes, especially whenever firearms were used (an increase by as much as 52 percent in the case of armed robbery). Economic offences went up by 11.9 percent, with expropriation of property up by 19.5 percent and rising steadily. Meanwhile, infringement upon excise tax regulations went up by 46.6 percent, forgeries by 26.3 percent and fiscal offences by 32.2 percent, with total losses ensuing from economic offences reaching PLN 570 million. @BTCENTRE = Basic Hazards
Police experts believe that the banking system is the most prone sphere of the national economy for the following reasons:
*the banking administration's disrespect for the provisions of the banking act, which results in credits granted to companies and individuals offering fictitious guarantees;
*credits granted to non-existing companies and individuals;
*fictitious bank guarantees offered to boost companies that are going bankrupt;
*putting earmarked credits to another use, also to finance illegal operations or repay loans owed to other banks;
*use of assets expropriated earlier to obtain loans;
*cooperation between bank personnel and the economic underground;
*forgery of banking documents.
In other spheres of the economy, the following mechanisms can frequently be observed: expropriation of assets or money by employees working as an organised group, extortion through failure to pay producers or wholesalers for goods shipped prior (e.g., coal) as well as failure to repay retailers for articles purchased in instalments, payment evasion through phony bankruptcies. Such offences committed by fictitious companies and individuals pose a serious threat to small and medium-sized firms, and this group of offences is thriving thanks to modern equipment that is making forgery of all documents a much easier task. Offences connected with ownership transformations are also hazardous, including:
*corruption of the representatives of parent bodies;
*deliberate undervaluation of enterprises in anticipation of their sale;
*sale of property components of privatised companies;
*forgery of tender documents to eliminate competitive bidders;
*overestimation or undervaluation of contributions in kind.
Customs offences in turn now centre on: fictitious transit of goods through Poland, fictitious export of domestic products, fictitious re-export of imported articles, lower value of imported goods declared and imports by fictitious importers. Contraband goods are usually those with the highest customs rates as well as those whose imports or exports are restricted or banned, e.g., cars, works of art, weapons, fuels, some consumer goods, tobacco and liquor. It is significant that contraband is to a large extent accompanied by the corruption of customs officers, and its scope and intensity are rooted in its organised and international nature, so effective police operations would require coordinated action undertaken by police forces in several countries at the same time.
Tax offences have also been escalating in recent years, and irregularities are perceptible in particular in the case of personal and corporate income taxes, VAT and excise taxes. Infringements upon the copyright act are another problem, although ensuing losses are hard to estimate. In general, no reliable estimates are available except in the case of offences embraced by police statistics, while such estimates would be vital to examining the scope of money-laundering in Poland.
Accompanying Crimes
Those responsible for organised economic offences are seeking maximum profits. With this objective achieved, they soon reach for power by any means possible, including corruption. Therefore, organised economic crime is frequently accompanied by common crimes, such as the corruption of civil servants, presence of gangs protecting illegal shipments or fighting competition, blackmail, intimidation, kidnappings, killings, bomb blasts to eliminate competitors or debtors, extortion or assaults on law-enforcement officers. Moreover, many former police and security service officers trained to fight organised crime are now on the underground's payroll after they have failed the screening process, and the number of specialists cooperating with gangs is rising, with experts as well as academics known to be offering their professional advice on forgery, the law or gaps in tax regulations.
In 1994-96, the police discovered over 300 gangs embracing nearly 5,000 professionals, including many repeat offenders. Polish organised crime has links to similar organisations in 28 major countries (with the exception of Australia), and over 30 mafia-style groups are now operating in Poland. A meeting of the cabinet has even been devoted to connections between businessmen and politicians on the one hand and organised crime on the other, and contacts between criminals and opinion-forming circles have also been uncovered. At the same time, international organisations are known to be fighting for Eastern European markets, with mafias from the East especially active in Poland, including Russian, Ukrainian, Belarussian, Chechen and even Vietnamese.
Meanwhile, domestic mafias have also been gaining fame recently, in particular those from Pruszkow and Wolomin (both outside Warsaw) specialising in paid protection and extortion. While it remains unclear if those are truly mafia-style groups, there is no doubt that domestic organised crime is learning from professionals in the U.S., Russia, Germany and other countries, although the organisation and functioning of Polish organised crime is bound to differ from traditional Italian or Asian organisations due to socio-cultural differences as well as distinct traditions and mores governing the criminal underground in Poland. @BTCENTRE = Drugs: Primary Source of Income
Although the sources of income acquired by organised crime seem fairly obvious, the ingenuity of gangs is infinite in this respect, especially that they immediately adjust to the demand in a given country or region, supplying radioactive materials or non-ferrous metals whenever necessary or offering to ship illegal immigrants. Traditionally, drug trafficking remains the primary source of revenue, however, yielding approximately $120-250 billion a year from hard drugs alone, with Western experts estimating that drugs are behind 80 percent of the world's dirty money.
In the early 70's, when the problem of drug abuse began to grow in Poland, Western specialists warned against a trail leading from the Golden Triangle (Burma, Laos, Thailand) via Poland to Western Europe, but Polish law-enforcement agencies centred instead on tracking petty domestic producers manufacturing narcotics from poppy. Meanwhile, rapidly rising drug abuse statistics in Poland are alarming and include addiction to hard drugs as well.
The warnings offered earlier by Western experts have since been confirmed, and we know now that drug trafficking routes lead through Poland, and even cross here. Heroin, for instance, is trafficked not only from the Golden Triangle, but also from the Golden Crescent (Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran) through the former USSR or North Africa. The chief route leads from Asia via Turkey, Bulgaria, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia to Germany, Denmark and Sweden, where police and customs officers are uncovering not kilograms but tons of narcotics.
Around 700 tons of heroin are believed to have been manufactured throughout the world in 1995, including 300 tons in the Golden Triangle, and some of it reached Western Europe via Poland. In a report on drug trafficking published by the U.S. State Department, Poland is described not only as Europe's leading amphetamine producer, but also as an important transit point for heroin and cocaine shipped to Western Europe. According to the report, drug syndicates from Colombia, Nigeria, India and Pakistan operate in Poland, organising their own transfer routes, for instance by plane via Prague/Warsaw and Gdynia/Gdansk to Western Europe and Scandinavia, while Colombian narcotics are trafficked through Poland to Italy.
Poland is now believed to be among the key transit points for the world's narcotics, with over 70 tons of drugs discovered by customs officers in 1992-95, including marijuana (35 tons), hashish (24 tons), cocaine (3.5 tons), heroin (450 kilograms) and amphetamines (200 kilograms). Meanwhile, customs officers are known to be capable of checking only 20-30 percent of the goods crossing the border.
At the same time, the number of laboratories manufacturing synthetic drugs, primarily amphetamines, is known to be rising, and secret laboratories throughout Poland specialise in producing high quality amphetamines subsequently dispatched from Warsaw and Szczecin to the island of Ruegen and on to Germany or Sweden. Police and Office of State Security (UOP) experts believe that amphetamines are also manufactured in legal laboratories run by research and industrial institutes, with production by researchers and their assistants discovered in some academic centres such as Poznan, Wroclaw and Warsaw.
According to Western analysts, Poland has strengthened its position among the world's leading producers of amphetamines and its derivatives, and the supply is so high in the West that the wholesale price of amphetamine has been dropping systematically (from $8-10,000 per kilogramme in 1993 to around $3,500 in 1994 and $2,500-2,800 in 1995). Retail prices are obviously much higher, and amphetamine production is so profitable that some signs indicate that foreign capital might be investing in the business, with laboratories moved from other countries to Poland. A professional laboratory can manufacture up to 15 kilograms of amphetamine per day, and the organisation as well as methods employed by gangs producing and trafficking it suggest that the business is controlled by professionals.
The scale of amphetamine production, trafficking and the profits involved are not known, but Western specialists believe over 200 laboratories are now functioning in Poland, including numerous high capacity facilities in the vicinity of Warsaw, Lodz and Szczecin. It is clear that only small fry were caught and brought to trial in recent police busts, while the big fish continue amassing huge profits. At the same time, the media are speculating about at least three drug syndicates functioning in Poland, devoting a lot of attention to such problems as police impotence and corruption embracing diplomats, law-enforcement officers and even Interpol functionaries. Police units from different countries are joining forces in the fight against drugs, but to no avail so far, because all attempts to curb drug abuse are thwarted due to the persisting high demand for narcotics.
Other Sources
Drugs are obviously not the sole source of income for organised gangs, and illegal arms sales are controlled by specialised corporations and international firms. Some are set up with this objective in mind, occasionally for a single transaction only. In most cases, they are seemingly innocent consulting firms, sometimes with just a post office box or one secretary, and they frequently vanish as soon as the deal is completed. Weapons sales are becoming more and more specialised as the offer is expanded to include not only pistols or grenades, but also tanks, fighter planes, missile launchers, uranium or plutonium, and shipments to countries embargoed by the U.N. mean extra profits.
According to German police sources, arms dealers from the Eastern bloc traditionally meet with buyers in Berlin and Vienna. While some doubt that components for nuclear warheads can really be purchased there, Poland is known to be the only country to have introduced radioactive checks at its borders not long ago. Previously, radioactive substances were able to cross Polish borders freely en route to the West, meaning more dirty money for gangs specialising in the business. Stolen and smuggled cars are another source of big money. Traditional trails for stolen vehicles used to lead from France to North Africa, but now vehicles are predominantly shipped from Western to Central and Eastern Europe. More and more "car mafias" are been discovered and those specialise in stealing luxury vehicles (Mercedes, BMW, Ferrari, Bentley and even Rolls-Royce) in Italy, France, Germany, Austria and Belgium. The cars are then sold in Romania, Bulgaria, Poland, Belarus, Ukraine and even the United Arab Emirates. Car trafficking
 gangs are powerful and influential, usually running their own chop-shops to change the colour of vehicles, serial numbers and forge registration documents. Moreover, they are continually growing stronger and extending their spheres of influence. Even police officers specialising in organised crime are sometimes taken in, as they are occasionally found to own a stolen car, which policemen in several countries are known to be looking for.
Over the past few years, several groups engaged in the sale of women abroad for prostitution have been brought to trial in Poland, and organised gangs of Poles cooperating with foreign criminals are usually involved. Many Polish children sold abroad have also been traced in the past three years, and Interpol believes around 1,500 Polish women are sold abroad each year and forced to work as prostitutes. On the other hand, it is difficult to establish the precise number of women willingly working in brothels and deciding to report a crime once determined to quit, and it is just as hard to determine how many have been lured by the prospect of easy money made abroad.
Organised transfer of illegal immigrants is a significant source of dirty money too, with fictitious tourist agencies using forged documents to smuggle illegal immigrants from Asia and Africa across Poland's Eastern border. The immigrants, who most frequently come from Iraq, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Djibouti, Ethiopia and Somalia, have to pay up to $4,000 to cross the border on foot, hidden behind cargo shipments or fly over it in a helicopter. Police and border guards in Poland and Germany are known to detain several thousand illegal immigrants from Asia each year, while the world's total profits from smuggling illegal immigrants are now estimated at $5-7 billion.
New sources of dirty money have also been discovered in recent years, including colossal fortunes made by organised groups engaged in illegal sales and transfer of non-ferrous metals, especially copper, nickel, aluminium and titanium. Non-ferrous metals are most frequently smuggled from Russia via Latvia to Third World countries or from Russia to Germany through Poland, and Polish customs officers are uncovering tons of non-ferrous metals smuggled across the border. @BTCENTRE = Financial Scandals and Second Economy
In Poland, a considerable amount of dirty money has additionally emerged as a consequence of major financial scandals and affairs, to mention only the leading ones, such as the Foreign Debt Servicing Fund (FOZZ), Art. B (banking) or Schnapsgate (liquor). The press has also reported about other less spectacular scandals, and in the case of some (e.g., fuels) the ensuing losses are hard to estimate, while information about many others has not yet reached the public or even law-enforcement agencies. Some publicised affairs have not been followed by indictments, with businessmen, customs officers and lower-ranking bank employees prevailing among the suspects, and occasionally former high state administration and banking officials as well. The Polish public is not being informed about the scale of economic, financial and credit scandals. For the time being, law-enforcement experts have no in-depth knowledge of their mechanisms either, and the same can be said about forgeries of bills, banking documents or excise 
bands.
We do know for a fact, however, that consumer durables crossing the border sometimes miraculously change into spirits or tobacco once cleared through customs, while liquor and tobacco products allegedly shipped through Poland in transit leave the country no more than sporadically. Under the circumstances, police and customs officers have to devote a lot of time and demonstrate their inventiveness if they want to emerge as winners from this game of hide-and-seek with the smugglers, whose ingenuity is close to perfection, while the profits made by their bosses surge.
The scale of organised economic crime on Poland's Eastern border is continually on the rise too, and hundreds of thousand of zloty as well as millions of dollars are involved here. Illegal flights are even organised to bring contraband from neighbouring countries to Poland, and revenues from smuggling and other forms of organised crime clearly boost the sums funnelled for laundering.
The second economy, which is now estimated at between PLN 21 and 38 billion, also plays a crucial role, and the value of the black economy's goods and services has risen by 10 percent over the past two years, which means it now accounts for around 16-19 percent of the GDP. It undoubtedly has a stimulating impact on the economy, offering jobs to thousands of people, especially skilled and unskilled workers and foreigners, with an estimated 2 million people employed in the shadow economy in 1995, when unemployment exceeded 2.5 million. Illegal jobs are the sole source of income for over 1 million Poles and no national insurance contributions are paid on an estimated 22-35 percent of pay in private companies. The second economy also helps buffer the consequences of market economy introduction, while its development is undoubtedly prompted by high taxes. On the other hand, ensuing losses in unpaid taxes and insurance contributions are hard to estimate, but it is obvious that tax evaders are left with more dirty 
money.
According to Interpol estimates, some $2-4 billion annually was laundered in Poland a few years ago, but experts believe this amount has since risen to around $8 billion each year. The scale of illegal profits remains a blank, and there are many areas for financial experts, customs officers, lawyers and law-enforcement agencies to examine. No statistics are available on estimated profits from prostitution, gambling, expropriation, tax evasion, crimes contracted with gangs or fraud, and experts should also hammer out new crime-detection and research methods. Meanwhile, some businessmen known for their shady dealings earlier are no longer worried about an influx of cash, centring instead on a search for new and swift money-laundering measures and profitable investments. It is also clear that more and more Polish dirty money is transferred abroad to be laundered.
Prognostics and Prevention
Research work on crime projections has essentially come to a standstill in the past decade and, therefore, reliable prognoses as well as prevention projects are practically non-existent. A report by Szczecin University criminologist, Professor Karol Slawik, seems to be the sole exception here, and his analysis based on crime statistics as well as socio-economic and population studies indicates that the following tendencies can be expected in the coming years:
*the number of murders will continue to rise, and those will be rooted in traditional motives as well as in feuds between gangs;
*the number of terrorist attacks might increase as a result of warfare between gangs;
*politically-motivated terrorist attacks cannot be ruled out either, and those are likely to be connected with Middle East terrorism, Islamic fundamentalism, post-Soviet nationalism, etc.;
*assault and battery, larceny and robbery (including robbery with violence) will be mounting, with the following among the primary targets: wealthy individuals, money transported in convoys, banks, currency exchange counters, taxi drivers, filling stations, etc.;
*more private homes and facilities as well as warehouses and expensive stores are expected to be burglarised;
*larceny will be on the rise, including pick-pockets as well as car theft by organised international groups;
*fraud will climb, with individuals as well as insurance companies among its chief victims;
*more forgeries will be attempted by organised groups;
*economic offences will go up, in particular those connected with capital transactions and banking, ownership transformations, customs, taxes and the ecology. Mismanagement and misappropriation are also expected to mount in companies, foundations and associations;
*the number of computer-related offences will grow, and criminals will be drawing more extensively on modern science and technology;
*the practice of laundering profits from all kinds of illegal transactions will escalate, and it is likely that groups of banking and financial experts will be trained with this objective in mind.
Crime-detection prognoses are alarming too, as impunity is expected to mount, especially in big cities. Slawik's report also predicts a rise in the number of offences connected with business dealings, corruption related to government orders, customs and tax concessions, information about new legislation and pressures exerted upon law-enforcement functionaries and the judiciary.
For the time being, police experts recommend utmost caution to safeguard against economic offences. They suggest that firms carefully screen their clients, collecting information and verifying their credibility before contracts are signed. Choice of renown business partners is recommended, and only original financial documents should be accepted.
Purchases should only be made from reliable suppliers that guarantee the quality of the product and its legitimate source, and attempts should be continued to set up national registers of credible firms and insolvent debtors. Those practical guidelines are clearly sketchy and fragmentary, however, while systemic proposals have been lacking for years, confirming that the task of drafting a comprehensive crime-prevention programme is a major challenge for researchers and for law-enforcement agencies alike.

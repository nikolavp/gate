     BOGOTA, April 10 (Reuter) - A reputed Italian mobster and a Peruvian drug lord were arrested on Thursday in separate incidents in Bogota and Colombia's steamy Caribbean port of Cartagena, authorities said.
     A statement from the state security police, known as the DAS, identified the Italian man who was nabbed in Cartagena as Domenico Nirta and described him as a leading figure in N'Drangheta, the Calabria-based mafia crime family.
     The statement said Nirta, a fugitive from Italian justice wanted on heroin trafficking charges in Milan, would be extradited within the next few days.
     In addition to its role at the world's largest producer of cocaine, Western drug experts say Colombia has recently become a leading supplier of heroin to the United States. They say links havbe existed between the Italian mob and Colombia's powerful drug cartels for years.
     Police earlier announced the arrest of a Peruvian who allegedly supplied cocaine base to Colombian traffickers.
     The National Police said in a statement that Enrique Cardenas Guzman, known as "Mosquito" or "Little Fly," was wanted on two outstanding drug charges in Peru where he was the target of an extradition request from Interpol.
     Cardenas was arrested by detectives after being found with a woman in a luxury apartment in Bogota, the statement said.
     It said he had taken over as head of a powerful drug gang after his father, nicknamed "Crazy Fly" and the group's previous boss, died in a Lima prison riot.
     Three-quarters of the world's cocaine is produced in Colombia. U.S. drug agents say most of it is produced in clandestine drug laboratories that refine cocaine base smuggled into the country by air and water routes from Peru.

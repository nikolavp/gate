    WASHINGTON, April 4 (Reuter) - A cocaine haul valued at $23 million was found in a load of bananas at a routine truck inspection near Evergreen, Ala., NBC television reported on Friday.
     An estimated 1,100 pounds (1.1 short tons) of cocaine, Alabama's largest drug seizure ever, was discovered after traffic control officers were alerted by a drug-sniffing dog, NBC said.
     Narcotics officers were then called in. The driver of the vehicle, a semi-trailer which was carrying about 30,000 pounds (15 short tons) of bananas, had been detained but had not been charged early on Friday, NBC said.
     An Alabama State Police dispatcher in Evergreen was unable to provide additional details.

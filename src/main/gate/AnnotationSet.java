 * <code>getAnnotations</code> methods of {@link Document}.
 * </p>

 * This interface provides methods to extract subsets of annotations
 * from the current set given various constraints. Note that the

 * called. Subsequent changes to the underlying set are not reflected in
 * the subset view.

 * This interface extends {@link java.util.Set}&lt;Annotation&gt;, so
 * can be used anywhere a Java Collections Framework <code>Set</code>

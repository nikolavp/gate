/**
   A generic implementation of pool of references to objects of any kind.
   It is thread-safe, so, allows multiple users to get and release objects
   "simultaneously". In fact, the standard Java synchronization is used.
   <BR><BR>
   The base idea is that, a calling routine will try to get
   an object from the pool with method Get. On success, it will use the
   object and return it in the pool with the method Put.
   <BR><BR>
   If there ares no available objects in the pool, Get will return <B>null</B>.
   Then the calling routine should create a new object. Further, scenario goes
   in the same way - when finished using the object, calling routine shoud Put
   it in the pool for future use, instead of leaving it to be garbage-collected.
   <BR><BR>
   The pool initially is empty. The only way to increase the number of objects
   managed by the pool, is some external process to Put an object, that was
   created, instead of previously Get from the pool.
   <BR><BR>
   Pool stores only references to currently "free" or available objects. When
   some external routine Gets an object from the pool, its reference is not
   locked, it is simply removed from the pool.

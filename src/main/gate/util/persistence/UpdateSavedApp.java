/**
 * <p>Handy command-line utility that loads a saved application state in the
 * old serialized-object format and resaves it in XML format.  Note that this
 * utility does not load the application into GATE and resave it, but merely
 * converts the persistent representation from one format to another.  If you
 * have an old-style saved state that will not load (because, for example, it
 * refers to a plugin that is not available) you can convert it to XML format
 * with this tool and then hand-edit the resulting XML to fix it.</p>
 *
 * <p>Usage: java -classpath &lt;gate.jar and lib/*.jar&gt;
 * gate.util.persistence.UpdateSavedApp &lt;oldFormatFile&gt;
 * &lt;newFormatFile&gt;</p>

/**
 * This represents a tuple query of the triple store for the ontology.
 * To create a tuple query object you must use the ontology's factory
 * method {@link Ontology#createTupleQuery(String, gate.creole.ontology.OConstants.QueryLanguage)}.
 * <p>
 * NOTE: querying the ontology triple store directly should be avoided and
 * only done in exceptional cases. Using the methods to query and access ontology
 * entities should be preferred whenever possible!
 * <p>
 * The query object implements a closable iterator that auto-closes when all
 * its elements are exhausted. However, you must close it if you stop retrieving
 * elements before all elements have been exhausted (i.e. before the
 * hasNext() method has returned false). Closing the query object is necessary
 * to free the considerable resources allocated by it.
 * <p>
 * To use a query object properly, be sure to follow the following steps:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Create the query object using the ontology's factory method
 * <li>Optionally set variable bindings using the setBinding method
 * <li>Evaluate the query. This is optional if you are not re-using a query
 * object with new binding settings
 * <li>Check if there is something available using the hasNext() method
 * <li>Retrieve the next tuple using the next() or nextAsString() method, or
 * using the nextFirst() or nextFirstAsString() method if you only need the
 * first or only variable in a tuple.
 * <li>Close the query if hasNext() has not returned false yet and you do not
 * need any more results from the query.
 * <li>If you want to re-use the query with different variable bindings
 * use method setBinding() and reevaluate using the method evaluate().
 * </uk>

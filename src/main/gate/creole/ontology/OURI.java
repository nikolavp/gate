 * these objects using their constructor (clients must never directly use
 * any classes from the inplementing packages below this package!).
 * In order to create OURIs the {@link Ontology} factory methods
 * {@link Ontology#createOURI(String)}, {@link Ontology#createOURIForName(String)},
 * or {@link Ontology#generateOURI(String)} must be used.

/**
 * <p>Marker interface used to mark the setter methods of JavaBean
 * properties that are <i>sharable</i>.  When a resource is
 * duplicated using {@link Factory#duplicate(gate.Resource)}
 * the values of any sharable properties from the original
 * resource will be copied by reference into the duplicate.
 * In particular, and sharable properties that are themselves
 * resources will <i>not</i> be recursively duplicated, even
 * if the properties are also marked as {@link CreoleParameter}s.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The Sharable marker is typically used for cases where a
 * resource creates at initialization time a data structure which
 * it subsequently accesses in a read-only fashion. Duplicates
 * of this resource can share a reference to the original's copy
 * of this data structure rather than having to build their
 * own identical copy.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The default {@link Factory#duplicate(gate.Resource)}
 * implementation sets sharable properties at the same time as
 * init parameters (i.e. after the constructor call but before
 * init() is called).  So resources that make use of sharable
 * properties need to check in their init() methods whether
 * the sharable properties have been set, and only do the
 * necessary initialization logic if the property values are
 * <code>null</code>.</p>

/**
 * <p>
 * This interface should be implemented by processing resources that
 * need to know when any containing controller starts and ends its
 * execution, for example to initialise internal data structures or to
 * do some aggregate processing of data gathered from a whole corpus.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If a controller contains several PRs that implement this interface,
 * the order in which their <code>controllerExecutionStarted</code> (<code>Finished</code>
 * or <code>Aborted</code>) methods are called is not specified. In
 * particular, the "ended" methods may be called in a different order
 * from the "started" ones. Also, if one PR throws an exception from its
 * <code>controllerExecutionFinished</code> method, the other finished
 * methods may not be called at all for this run. PRs should be robust
 * to this possibility.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If the processing resource implementing this interface is contained in
 * a conditional controller the methods defined by this interface are invoked
 * independently of the RunningStrategy for the processing resource: even if
 * the PR is disabled, the methods will get invoked. The method
 * {@link gate.Utils#isEnabled(Controller, ProcessingResource)} can be used
 * inside the implementation of the methods defined in this interface 
 * if necessary to find out if the processing resource has a chance to run
 * in the controller.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The controller should call this PRs started and finished (or aborted)
 * methods at most once per run, even if the controller allows the same
 * PR to be added multiple times.
 * </p>

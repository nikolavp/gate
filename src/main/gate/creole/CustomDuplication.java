   * Typical uses for resource duplication are multi-threaded
   * applications that require a number of identical resources for

   * duplicates created by this method should be safe for concurrent use
   * in multiple threads - in some cases it may be appropriate for the
   * duplicate to share some state with the original object, but this
   * must be handled in a thread-safe manner.

   * <p>
   * Implementors of this interface should <i>not</i> use covariant
   * return types, as to do so may limit the flexibility of subclasses
   * to implement duplication in the most efficient manner.

   *          it should pass this context back to the two-argument form of
   *          {@link Factory#duplicate(Resource, DuplicationContext) Factory.duplicate}
   *          rather than using the single-argument form.
   * @return an independent copy of this resource.

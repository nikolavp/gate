/**
 * <p>
 * A set of annotations on a document. Simple annotation sets support
 * creation of new annotations and access to subsets of the annotations
 * in the set by annotation type. Annotation sets are attached to
 * documents - they cannot be constructed directly, but are obtained via
 * the <code>getAnnotations</code> methods of {@link Document}.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This interface provides methods to get all annotations of a
 * particular type or set of types from the current set. Note that the
 * annotation sets returned by these <code>get</code> methods are
 * immutable snapshots of the set as it was at the time the method was
 * called. Subsequent changes to the underlying set are not reflected in
 * the subset view.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This interface extends {@link java.util.Set}&lt;Annotation&gt;, so
 * can be used anywhere a Java Collections Framework <code>Set</code>
 * or <code>Collection</code> is required.

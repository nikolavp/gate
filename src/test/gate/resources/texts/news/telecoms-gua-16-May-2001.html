		  <FONT FACE="Geneva,Arial,sans-serif" SIZE=2>Energis chief executive Mike Grabiner stunned investors yesterday when he announced his departure from the firm he has built from an underperforming part of the National Grid to a fixture in the FTSE 100. <P>Mr Grabiner, who will step down in July, immediately ruled himself out as a potential successor to BT's beleaguered chief executive, Sir Peter Bonfield. The highly regarded executive had been widely tipped as a possible candidate should Sir Peter leave BT before the end of his contract in December 2002.  <P>Mr Grabiner, who cashed in share options worth nearly &#163;9m in November 1999, said he would be taking some time off to consider what his next step should be.  <P>"I have always felt that if I could build Energis to proven success, I would consider doing something totally different with the rest of my career," he said. "I have no job to go to and no idea what I'll end up doing. I just know I'm 50 and I want to do something different while I'm young and energetic enough to do it. The BT job is not for me. I've spent 27 years in telecoms and I don't want to run another telecoms company."   <P>Mr Grabiner will receive no pay-off but before he leaves will cash in around &#163;3.2m from exercising options on 1.6m shares awarded to him last year. He still has around 440,000 shares.  <P>Mr Grabiner's departure coincided with Energis moving into pre-tax profit for the first time in its domestic market. The company made &#163;3.2m in the UK for the year to April although younger operations in mainland Europe dragged Energis into a pretax loss of more than &#163;100m. The company is forecasting a pretax profit from its overseas operations in the 2003-2004 financial year.  <P>Turnover of &#163;840.4m was 70% higher compared with the previous year.  <P>Mr Grabiner joined Energis as chief executive in 1996 and guided the company from an underperforming division of the National Grid through to a successful stock market flotation in 1997. The company is worth &#163;4.7bn.  <P>When he took over, the business had revenues of just &#163;42.7m and losses at the Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) level of &#163;42.6m.  <P>His only other job had been at BT. He joined the Post Office as a graduate trainee in its telecoms department before it was spun off as BT and rose to the job of director of its European operations.  <P>Shares in Energis fell 9% in early trade. "It's not very good news at all for the company," said one analyst. "He has a fantastic reputation in the market." By the close, however, they had recovered their loses and were 5p higher at 276p.  <P>Mr Grabiner will be replaced by chief operating officer David Wickham, who joined Energis from Cable &amp; Wireless at the end of 1999. At C&amp;W he had been in charge of delivering a single international voice and internet capability for the group. </FONT>

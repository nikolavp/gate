		  <FONT FACE="Geneva,Arial,sans-serif" SIZE=2>Cable &amp; Wireless will commit itself this week to an aggressive acquisition strategy to use up its &#163;7 billion cash pile. But it will not rule out giving some of the money back to shareholders in future. <P>Chief executive Graham Wallace has been under increasing pressure to return to investors some of the cash amassed from selling minority stakes and joint ventures around the world.  <P>One of C&amp;W's biggest institutional shareholders said &#163;7bn was too much to spend: 'It is equal to half its market value. That is too much cash for their own good. They should give back &#163;5bn.'  <P>Others called on C&amp;W to give them the cash to fund the &#163;5.9bn rights issue launched by BT.  <P>But Wallace is understood to believe it would be 'crazy' to give back the money when telecoms and internet businesses are trading at rock-bottom prices. Only &#163;2bn is actually in its bank now. The rest - including a similar sum due from the sale of C&amp;W Optus, the company's Australian division, to Singapore Telecom last March - is not yet in.  <P>C&amp;W's shares have halved in value since it issued a profit warning in March, and Wallace will be anxious to restore the company's credibility in the City.  <P>He gained considerable credit for unravelling the network of shareholdings and joint ventures that made C&amp;W more like an investment trust than a telecoms company, but the profit warning and the failure to make acquisitions have dented his reputation.  <P>He will attempt to restore it by outlining a detailed acquisition strategy, showing how he will use the cash and explaining the level of debt he believes is optimum for the group. Although there have been talks about a number of   deals, it is believed to be unlikely that any will come to fruition in time for Wednesday's results announcement.  <P>C&amp;W's name has been linked to virtually every telecoms business. Jim McCafferty, telecoms analyst with SG Warburg, said the acquisition of a US web-hosting business was likely to be a priority. The group's strategy has been to concentrate on internet protocol and business data. It has few interests in mobile phones, which have given its rivals problems.  <P>But its disposal programme, coupled with the slowdown in its markets, means earnings this year - which it said in March would be between 14p and 16p - would not cover the dividend if it stays at last year's level of 16.5p. While the City does not expect a cut, which would send the wrong signal from a firm with so much cash, it could warn of a future reduction, with the compensation of a special dividend. </FONT>

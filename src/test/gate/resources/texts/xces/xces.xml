The four versions of Orwell's 1984 in the OTA were all prepared by the
OUCS KDEM service in 1985 for Dr David C Bennett of the School of
Oriental And African Studies at London University.  The texts here
have not been encoded or proofread in any way since they were produced
(other than the English text, which was converted to an SGML like
encoding by John Price-Wilkin, and subsequently automatically
converted to conform to the OTA's dtd by myself and Alan Morrison. The
other languages were converted to TEI conformant SGML by the ECI
project 1993.) &mdash;&mdash;LB, Nov 1992

Rendition attribute values on Q, QUOTE, MENTIONED and TERM tags are
adapted from ISOpub and ISOnum standard entity set names when used.
If the rend attribute is ommited in the markup the rendition on the
first set of Q, QUOTE, MENTIONED or TERM tags is "PRE lsquo POST
rsquo" and the rendition on Q, MENTIONED or TERM tag nested in a Q or
QUOTE tag is "PRE ldquo POST rdquo"

Abbreviations are marked only within marked names. Other abbreviations
are not marked.
</tagUsage>
<tagUsage gi="body" occurs="1"></tagUsage>
<tagUsage gi="date" occurs="40">
All dates which contain one or more digits (the characters 0-9) are
marked, including dates specifying day/month/year and dates consisting
only of a year. No attempt was made to identify or mark dates in other forms.
</tagUsage>
<tagUsage gi="distinct" occurs="1"></tagUsage>
<tagUsage gi="div" occurs="28"></tagUsage>
<tagUsage gi="foreign" occurs="39">
The Newspeak words "thoughtcrime" and "doublethink" are consistently
marked as FOREIGN, when they do not appear in some other tag where the
lang attribute provides the language information. Latin and French
words are also marked.
</tagUsage>
<tagUsage gi="head" occurs="1"></tagUsage>
<tagUsage gi="hi" occurs="103">
The highlighting tag is used to mark words and phrases which were
typographically distinguished in the printed version of the text, and
for which no other more precise tag is applicable. In most of these
cases, such highlighting signifies emphasis.

<tagUsage gi="list" occurs="1"></tagUsage>
<tagUsage gi="mentioned" occurs="261">Rendition information has not been
systematically retained.  When no rendition information is provided,
rendering is generally in italics in the 1949 Harcourt, Brace and World
Edition of Ninteeen Eighty-Four.  The original
electronic version contained rendition information inconsistent with
the 1949 Harcourt edition.</tagUsage>
<tagUsage gi="name" occurs="1744">
Frequently occurring names of people, places, organizations,
products, languages, and events, are marked.  If a name is marked, every
occurrence of that name is marked.
Person names in the genitive are not marked to include the English genitive
suffix "'s". For other names, only those occurrences which function as
stand-alone proper nouns are marked; adjectival uses (e.g., "Newspeak
words") are not marked.

<tagUsage gi="num" occurs="52">
Anything containing one or more digits (the characters 0-9) that is
not part of a date, and all roman numerals, are marked as a
number. In cases where a ratio is expressed (per cent, per thousand),
the entire phrase (e.g., "10 per cent") is marked as a number.

<tagUsage gi="poem" occurs="10"></tagUsage>
<tagUsage gi="ptr" occurs="2"></tagUsage>
<tagUsage gi="q" occurs="2209">
The Q tag is used to mark quoted dialogue. The attribute
"type=indirect" is used when attributed speech is marked
typographically in the printed text (e.g., "I know you," he seemed to
say). The attribute "type=written" is used in those cases where
Winston's writing in his diary is represented as quoted thought (e.g.,
"If there is hope," he wrote, "it lies in the Proles.").  If no "rend"
attribute is provided on the Q tag, the value is assumed to be "PRE
ldquo" on the first Q in a series of Qs within the same P unbroken by
#PCDATA and "POST rdquo" on the last Q in the series.  The attribute
"broken=yes" is used when no sentence terminating punctuation (either
inside the Q itself or in the intervening text between two Qs) appears
between two dialogue fragments by the same speaker.

of solid-looking men with expressionless Asiatic faces, who swam up to
the surface of the screen and vanished, to be replaced by others
exactly similar.</s>
<s id="Oen.1.1.28.8">The dull rhythmic tramp of the soldiers' boots formed
the background to
<name type="person">Goldstein</name>'s
bleating voice.</s>
</p><p id="Oen.1.1.29">
<s id="Oen.1.1.29.1">Before the

had proceeded for thirty seconds, uncontrollable exclamations of rage
were breaking out from half the people in the room.</s>
<s id="Oen.1.1.29.2">The self-satisfied
sheep-like face on the screen, and the terrifying power of the
Eurasian army behind it, were too much to be borne: besides, the sight
or even the thought of
<name type="person">Goldstein</name>
produced fear and anger automatically.</s>
<s id="Oen.1.1.29.3">He was an object of hatred more
constant than either
<name type="place">Eurasia</name>
or

since when
<name type="place">Oceania</name>
was at war with one of these Powers it was generally at peace with the
other.</s>
<s id="Oen.1.1.29.4">But what was strange was that although
<name type="person">Goldstein</name>
was hated and despised by everybody, although every day and a thousand
times a day, on platforms, on the telescreen, in newspapers, in books,
his theories were refuted, smashed, ridiculed, held up to the general
gaze for the pitiful rubbish that they were in spite of all this, his
influence never seemed to grow less.</s>
<s id="Oen.1.1.29.5">Always there were fresh dupes
waiting to be seduced by him.</s>
<s id="Oen.1.1.29.6">A day never passed when spies and
saboteurs acting under his directions were not unmasked by the
<name type="org">Thought Police</name>.</s>
<s id="Oen.1.1.29.7">He was the commander of a vast shadowy army, an
underground network
of conspirators dedicated to the overthrow of the State.</s>
<s id="Oen.1.1.29.8">The
<name type="org">Brotherhood</name>,
its name was supposed to be.</s>
<s id="Oen.1.1.29.9">There were also whispered stories of a
terrible book, a compendium of all the heresies, of which
<name type="person">Goldstein</name>
was the author and which circulated clandestinely here and there.</s>
<s id="Oen.1.1.29.10">It
was a book without a title.</s>
<s id="Oen.1.1.29.11">People referred to it, if at all, simply
as

<s id="Oen.1.1.29.12">But one knew of such things only through vague

<s id="Oen.1.1.29.13">Neither the
<name type="org">Brotherhood</name>
nor

was a subject that any ordinary

member would mention if there was a way of avoiding it.</s>
</p><p id="Oen.1.1.30">
<s id="Oen.1.1.30.1">In its second minute the
<name type="event">Hate</name>
rose to a frenzy.</s>
<s id="Oen.1.1.30.2">People were leaping up and down in their places and
shouting at the tops of their voices in an effort to drown the
maddening bleating voice that came from the screen.</s>
<s id="Oen.1.1.30.3">The little
sandy-haired woman had turned bright pink, and her mouth was opening
and shutting like that of a landed fish.</s>
<s id="Oen.1.1.30.4">Even
<name type="person">O'Brien</name>'s
heavy face was flushed.</s>
<s id="Oen.1.1.30.5">He was sitting very straight in his chair,
his powerful chest swelling and quivering as though he were standing
up to the assault of a wave.</s>
<s id="Oen.1.1.30.6">The dark-haired girl behind
<name type="person">Winston</name>
had begun crying out
<q id="Oen.1.1.30.6.2" rend="PRE lsquo">Swine! Swine! Swine!</q>
and suddenly she picked up a heavy
Newspeak dictionary and flung it at the screen.</s>
<s id="Oen.1.1.30.7">It struck
<name type="person">Goldstein</name>'s
nose and bounced off; the voice continued inexorably.</s>
<s id="Oen.1.1.30.8">In a lucid moment
<name type="person">Winston</name>
found that he was shouting with the others and kicking his heel
violently against the rung of his chair.</s>
<s id="Oen.1.1.30.9">The horrible thing about the
<name type="event">Two Minutes Hate</name>
was not that one was obliged to act a part, but, on the contrary, that
it was impossible to avoid joining in.</s>
<s id="Oen.1.1.30.10">Within thirty seconds any
pretence was always unnecessary.</s>
<s id="Oen.1.1.30.11">A hideous ecstasy of fear and
vindictiveness, a desire to kill, to torture, to smash faces in with a
sledge-hammer, seemed to flow through the whole group of people like
an electric current, turning one even against one's will into a
grimacing, screaming lunatic.</s>
<s id="Oen.1.1.30.12">And yet the rage that one felt was an
abstract, undirected emotion which could be switched from one object
to another like the flame of a blowlamp.</s>
<s id="Oen.1.1.30.13">Thus, at one moment
<name type="person">Winston</name>'s
hatred was not turned against
<name type="person">Goldstein</name>
at all, but, on the contrary, against
<name type="person">Big Brother</name>,
the
<name type="org">Party</name>,
and the
<name type="org">Thought Police</name>;
and at such moments his heart went out to the lonely, derided
heretic on the screen, sole guardian of truth and sanity in a world of
lies.</s>
<s id="Oen.1.1.30.14">And yet the very next instant he was at one with
the people
about him, and all that was said of
<name type="person">Goldstein</name>
seemed to him to be true.</s>
<s id="Oen.1.1.30.15">At those moments his secret loathing of
<name type="person">Big Brother</name>
changed into adoration, and
<name type="person">Big Brother</name>
seemed to tower up, an invincible, fearless protector, standing like a
rock against the hordes of Asia, and
<name type="person">Goldstein</name>,
in spite of his isolation, his helplessness, and the doubt that hung
about his very existence, seemed like some sinister enchanter, capable
by the mere power of his voice of wrecking the structure of
civilization.</s>
</p><p id="Oen.1.1.31">
<s id="Oen.1.1.31.1">It was even possible, at moments, to switch one's hatred
this way or that by a voluntary act.</s>
<s id="Oen.1.1.31.2">Suddenly, by the sort
of violent effort with which one wrenches one's head away
from the pillow in a nightmare,
<name type="person">Winston</name>
succeeded in transferring his hatred from the face on the screen to
the dark-haired girl behind him.</s>
<s id="Oen.1.1.31.3">Vivid, beautiful hallucinations
flashed through his mind.</s>
<s id="Oen.1.1.31.4">He would flog her to death with a rubber
truncheon.</s>
<s id="Oen.1.1.31.5">He would tie her naked to a stake and shoot her full of
arrows like
<name type="person">Saint Sebastian</name>.</s>
<s id="Oen.1.1.31.6">He would ravish her and cut her throat at the moment of climax.</s>
<s id="Oen.1.1.31.7">Better than before, moreover, he realized why it was that he hated
her.</s>
<s id="Oen.1.1.31.8">He hated her because she was young and pretty and sexless,
because he wanted to go to bed with her and would never do so, because
round her sweet supple waist, which seemed to ask you to encircle it
with your arm, there was only the odious scarlet sash, aggressive
symbol of chastity.</s>
</p><p id="Oen.1.1.32">
<s id="Oen.1.1.32.1">The
<name type="event">Hate</name>
rose to its climax.</s>
<s id="Oen.1.1.32.2">The voice of
<name type="person">Goldstein</name>
had become an actual sheep's bleat, and for an instant the face
changed into that of a sheep.</s>
<s id="Oen.1.1.32.3">Then the sheep-face melted into the
figure of a Eurasian soldier who seemed to be advancing, huge and
terrible, his sub-machine gun roaring, and seeming to spring out of
the surface of the screen, so that some of the people in the front row
actually flinched backwards in their seats.</s>
<s id="Oen.1.1.32.4">But in the same moment,
drawing a deep sigh of relief from everybody, the hostile figure
melted into the face of
<name type="person">Big Brother</name>,
black-haired, blackmoustachio'd, full of power and mysterious calm,
and so vast that it almost filled up the screen.</s>
<s id="Oen.1.1.32.5">Nobody heard what
<name type="person">Big Brother</name>
was saying.</s>
<s id="Oen.1.1.32.6">It was merely a few words of encouragement, the sort of
words that are uttered in the din of battle, not distinguishable
individually but restoring confidence by the fact of being
spoken.</s>
<s id="Oen.1.1.32.7">Then the face of
<name type="person">Big Brother</name>
faded away again, and instead the three slogans of the
<name type="org">Party</name>
stood out in bold capitals:
<q id="Oen.1.1.32.7.3" rend="CE CA" type="slogan">War is peace</q>
<q id="Oen.1.1.32.7.4" rend="CE CA" type="slogan">Freedom is slavery</q>
<q id="Oen.1.1.32.7.5" rend="CE CA" type="slogan">Ignorance is strength.</q></s>
</p><p id="Oen.1.1.33">
<s id="Oen.1.1.33.1">But the face of
<name type="person">Big Brother</name>
seemed to persist for several seconds on the screen, as though the
impact that it had made on everyone's eyeballs was too vivid to wear
off immediately.</s>
<s id="Oen.1.1.33.2">The little sandyhaired woman had flung herself
forward over the back of the chair in front of her.</s>
<s id="Oen.1.1.33.3">With a tremulous
murmur that sounded like
<q id="Oen.1.1.33.3.1" rend="PRE lsquo POST rsquo">My Saviour!</q>
she extended her arms towards the screen.</s>
<s id="Oen.1.1.33.4">Then she buried her face in
her hands.</s>
<s id="Oen.1.1.33.5">It was apparent that she was uttering a prayer.</s>
</p><p id="Oen.1.1.34">
<s id="Oen.1.1.34.1">At this moment the entire group of people broke into a deep, slow,
rhythmical chant of

&mdash; over and over again, very slowly, with a long pause between
the first
<mentioned rend="PRE lsquo POST rsquo">B</mentioned>
and the second &mdash; a heavy, murmurous sound, somehow curiously
savage, in the background of which one seemed to hear the stamp of
naked feet and the throbbing of tom-toms.</s> 
<s id="Oen.1.1.34.2">For perhaps as much as
thirty seconds they kept it up.</s>
<s id="Oen.1.1.34.3">It was a refrain that was often heard
in moments of overwhelming emotion.</s>
<s id="Oen.1.1.34.4">Partly it was a sort of hymn to
the wisdom and majesty of
<name type="person">Big Brother</name>,
but still more it was an act of self-hypnosis, a deliberate drowning
of consciousness by means of rhythmic noise.</s>
<s id="Oen.1.1.34.5"><name type="person">Winston</name>'s
entrails seemed to grow cold.</s>
<s id="Oen.1.1.34.6">In the

chanting of

<name type="person"><abbr expan="Big Brother">B-B</abbr></name>!
&hellip;
<name type="person"><abbr expan="Big Brother">B-B</abbr></name>!

always filled him with horror.</s>
<s id="Oen.1.1.34.7">Of course he chanted with the rest: it
was impossible to do otherwise.</s>
<s id="Oen.1.1.34.8">To dissemble your feelings, to control
your face, to do what everyone else was doing, was an instinctive
reaction.</s>
<s id="Oen.1.1.34.9">But there was a space of a couple of seconds during which
the expression of his eyes might conceivably have betrayed him.</s>

it was exactly at this moment that the significant thing happened
&mdash; if, indeed, it did happen.</s>

there was a fraction of a second when their eyes met, and for as long
as it took to happen
<name type="person">Winston</name>
knew &mdash; yes, he
<hi rend="IT">knew!</hi>
&mdash; that
<name type="person">O'Brien</name>
was thinking the same thing as himself.</s>
<s id="Oen.1.1.35.5">An unmistakable message had
passed.</s>
<s id="Oen.1.1.35.6">It was as though their two minds had opened and

<s id="Oen.1.1.35.11">
And then the flash of intelligence was gone, and

<s id="Oen.1.1.36.1">That was all, and he was already uncertain whether it had

really existed!</s>

was not simply a myth.</s>

<s id="Oen.1.1.36.7">There was no evidence, only fleeting glimpses that
might mean anything
or nothing: snatches of overheard conversation, faint scribbles on
lavatory walls &mdash; once, even, when two strangers met, a small
movement of the hand which had looked as though it might be a signal
of recognition.</s>
<s id="Oen.1.1.36.8">It was all guesswork: very likely he had imagined
everything.</s>

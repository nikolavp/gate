02Apr97 BRAZIL:  INVESTIGATION INTO MONEY-LAUNDERING TO BE LAUNCHED.
Source: `ABC Color', Asuncion, in Spanish 31 Mar 97
Excerpts from report by Paraguayan newspaper `ABC Color' on 31st March
At last, the Money or Assets-Laundering Prevention Secretariat [Spanish: Secretaria de Prevencion de Lavado de Dinero o Bienes], presided over by Industry and Commerce Minister Ubaldo Scavone, has decided to assume investigation into alleged acts of whitewashing denounced by Brazilian legislators. The operations in question involve Brazilian and Paraguayan financial bodies. In an official communique, the institution created by law to sanction money-laundering reported that all the details of the inquiry will be maintained under bank secrecy until cases with the evidence supporting them are referred to the court.
The information obtained by the secretariat will be investigated as from this week. Technicians will track down accounts with unusual operations and will report to the Attorney-General's Office in case they find indications of possible cases of money-laundering.
The entire investigation will be conducted under a veil of silence imposed by the bank secrecy law. The Attorney-General's Office can release the name of the institutions and persons affected by the investigation only if there is hard evidence that money-laundering has taken place.
According to the law that defines the crime, an operation can be classified as money-laundering only when it is possible to prove that the origin of the funds is illegal or the money comes from a criminal organization. The evidence that funds were introduced into the economy in general or the financial system in particular without the authorities knowing the origin of those funds, is insufficient.
The inquiry became necessary after a report on foreign exchange operations submitted by Victor Chamorro, former banks superintendent and current National Development Bank (BNF) president, was made public. The report says that financial bodies in Pedro Juan Caballero and Ciudad del Este mediate in the transfer of 20m dollars a day...
The Brazilian Central Bank will shortly ask for information on current accounts opened in banks that operate in the Paraguayan market and where part of the funds obtained following a colossal fiscal swindle in that country have been deposited.

02Apr97 TAIWAN:  GOVT PLANS TO START 'WAR ON MONEY LAUNDERING' ON APRIL 23.
Taipei (CENS)-The government will officially start a war against money laundering on April 23 by requiring all financial institutions to confirm large financial transactions (exceeding NT$1.5 million in the same day), keep trading records and file reports to relevant government agencies.
In order to help fight international money laundering, the ministries of Finance and Justice have designated Hongkong, the Caymen and Bahama islands in the Caribbean as well as nations in Indochina and Central and South America as "high risk areas."
Financial institutions are obliged to report on those financial accounts that have more frequent transactions. Executives of banks that fail to do so will be fined or even prosecuted.
In addition to the mandatory reports of large transactions, the banks must contact the Bureau of Investigation about unusual and "suspected money laundering operations."
Such operations include the sudden showing of large deposits that do not match the identity and income of the persons when the money comes from sources unrelated to the persons' own business operations, the abrupt emerging of large deposits in passive accounts, the unusually quick transfers of money, or the frequent changes of small bills into large-denomination bills or vice versa.

RTna 4/2/97 6:57 PM   

    BOGOTA (Reuter) - The U.S. Coast Guard and the Colombian navy seized 1,440 pounds of cocaine in a joint operation in waters close to the Caribbean islands of San Andres and Providencia Wednesday, officials said.
     A U.S. patrol vessel initially gave chase to a high-powered speedboat suspected of transporting drugs and alerted the Colombian authorities when the craft headed into territorial waters around the two islands under Colombian jurisdiction.
     Part of the illegal narcotics shipment was dumped into the sea and the rest was found aboard the boat which was abandoned on an isolated beach in Providencia. No arrests were made, according to a statement by the Colombian navy.
     Colombia and the United States signed a maritime interdiction accord in February granting formal powers to the U.S. Coast Guard to board Colombian vessels suspected of drug trafficking outside the country's 12-mile territorial limit.

02Apr97 TURKEY:  $30M ANNUALLY TO FIGHT DRUG SMUGGLING.
According to the local press (March 31), Ismail Caliskan, Deputy Head of the Smuggling and Organized Crime Department at the Security Directorate, said that Turkey was being unfairly criticized by Europeans on the issue of drug trafficking, and added that Turkey was not a drug depot as claimed, but rather the protective shield of Europe against drug trafficking. According to Caliskan, Turkey gave great priority to fighting drug trafficking since it was one of the ways terrorist organizations financed their activities. He recalled that 65 percent of the total amount of drugs seized in Europe had been seized by the Turkish police and that $30m annually was spent on fighting drug smuggling.

	 Portugal Seizes More Than 6,000 Kilograms of Drugs ...

OTC  4/3/97 4:34 AM   

 LISBON (April 2) XINHUA - Portuguese police seized a total of 6,218  kilograms of narcotics in 1996 and arrested 3,724 people suspected of  drug trafficking, a police report said today. 
   The report said the drugs included 811.5 kilograms of cocaine, 46.7  kilograms of heroin and 5,324 kilograms of marijuana. 
   Among the drug-trafficking-related suspects, 449 were foreigners and 2,  926 were Portuguese drug addicts, the report said. 
   Earlier police reports show that drug users in Portugal have exceeded  100,000 at present, making Portugal one of the leading countries in the  European Union with the largest number of drug users. 
   The number is still on the rise with a growing population of young drug  addicts, police officials said. 
   The Portuguese government has launched an anti-drug campaign while  beefing up anti-drug measures. 
   Due to its location on the Iberian peninsula between the Atlantic Ocean  and the European continent, Portugal has been an easy way for drug  trafficking from other parts of the world to Europe.  Enditem

    EL PASO, Texas (Reuter) - U.S. anti-narcotics officials said Wednesday they would turn to the military for new high-tech equipment in their campaign to stop illegal drugs coming in across the border with Mexico.
     Senior Drug Enforcement Administration agents and Border Patrol chiefs met in the Texas city of El Paso Wednesday and vowed to increase border surveillance with the help of the most advanced technology.
     "We're going to tap into the Department of Defense and borrow night-vision devices and radar from the military," said Dennis Usrey, chairman of the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, a group formed in 1990 to fight the border drug trade.
     "We're going to work smarter, not harder," he said, but he did not give further details on exactly what type of new equipment would be deployed.
     Federal agents estimate that some $50 billion worth of illegal drugs is moved into the United States across the Mexican border each year.

    BOGOTA, April 2 (Reuter) - The United States could conditionally "recertify" Colombia as an ally in the drug war this year, U.S. ambassador Myles Frechette said on Wednesday, just a month after Washington blacklisted the country.
     "Colombia could be moved up a grade before the end of the year if certain things that we are currently discussing are carried out," Frechette told reporters after an official event at the presidential palace.
     If Washington decides Colombia has made progress in the fight against drug trafficking it could grant this Andean nation "certification with a national interest waiver," halfway between full approval and blacklisting.
     The envoy also said he would begin consultations with President Bill Clinton and the U.S. Congress next week in a bid to free up extra military aid for Colombia, currently blocked under the terms of the U.S. certification.
     Colombia was decertified by the United States for the second consecutive year at the end of February. In addition to condemning Colombia as an international drug pariah, the decision means hefty cuts in U.S. economic aid, although counternarcotics aid is not affected.
     Frechette declined to say what measures he was discussing with President Ernesto Samper's administration. Last year the Colombian Congress passed laws on tougher jail terms for drug-related crimes in the face of intense U.S. pressure.
     But Washington has also been demanding that Colombia lift its 1991 ban on extraditing Colombians to stand trial abroad -- a stance which has generated acute tensions with senior Colombian government ministers and a grassroots anti-American backlash.
     Frechette sought to play down those tensions Wednesday, saying: "Forget the U.S. position. Extradition is something that is essential for international cooperation against organised crime."
     Despite Colombia's decertification, the United States has pledged more than $80 million in counternarcotics aid together with a multimillion-dollar package of material aid, including crop dusting planes and helicopters.
     Figures were not available on how much Washington may grant Colombia in additional military aid if Congress approves the move.

    MEXICO CITY (Reuter) - Mexico's former antidrug czar Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, already in jail on drug corruption charges, will also be put on trial by the military, the Ministry of Defense said Wednesday.
     A Defense Ministry statement said the military charges were for crimes committed while the general was commander of the Guadalajara military region. The statement did not say what the new charges were.
     Gutierrez Rebollo was head of Mexico's National Institute for the Combat of Drugs for two months until he was arrested in late February on charges of criminal association, the transport of cocaine and receiving bribes.
     He was alledgedly on the payroll of Amado Carrillo Fuentes, the country's most powerful drug trafficker.
     The general's arrest was a deep embarrassment for the government of President Ernesto Zedillo.

		  Vietnam to Set up New Anti-Drug Body

OTC  4/2/97 7:24 PM   

 HANOI (April 2) XINHUA - Vietnam will set up an anti-drug police  department to fight the growing drug abuses and trafficking in the  country, an official report said today. 
   The new department will assist the police chief in directing the fight  against drug-related crimes and ensuring security and social order. 
   Anti-narcotics police handled more than 3,800 drug trafficking cases in  1996 and arrested 6,650 people for drug-related offenses. But drug  trafficking and abuses are still on the rise. 
   There are about 140,000 drug addicts nationwide, according to a  national anti-drug program.  Enditem

    By Suna Erdem
     ISTANBUL, Turkey (Reuter) - A Turkish parliament draft report on state-underworld ties painted a bleak picture of right-wing gangsters using state privileges to kill and trade guns and drugs while their friends in parliament were made ministers.
     But the draft report, obtained by Reuters Wednesday, stopped short of pointing a finger at any of the star-studded list of suspects attacked by the local media after a crash in which a top policeman and wanted gangster died in the same car.
     "Some unofficial groups have come to operate the workings of the state and the state organization has degenerated," the report said. "These people have even come to influence the congresses of political parties in Turkey."
     "People mentioned in state security reports as having links with the mafia have been promoted to the most important positions. These people have even been made ministers," the report said, but mentioned no names.
     The draft report, whose details will be finalized late Wednesday by an all-party commission, also purported to throw light on the numerous unsolved murders in southeast Turkey.
     It quotes a man called Huseyin Oguz, whose position it does not identify, as saying, "In the evening the intelligence services would bring us a list and in the morning the hitmen would go and kill (those on) the lists."
     A government member of parliament (MP), Sedat Bucak, who heads a tribal militia fighting separatist Kurdish guerrillas in the southeast, was in the same car as the policeman and the gangster when it crashed in the town of Susurluk in November.
     The commission will consider a demand by a top prosecutor to lift the parliamentary immunities of Bucak and Mehmet Agar, who resigned as interior minister after the crash, so they can be tried for abuse of position and harboring wanted men.
     Agar's resignation and an unprecedented public outcry raised hopes of a thorough inquiry into alleged state-gangland links.
     But only 10 people, mostly low-ranking policemen, have been charged by an Istanbul court investigating the crash, and the commission draft report only implicated a handful of people -- including one of the 10 charged and two people who are dead.
     The commission, mostly government MPs, voted against questioning Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller and a top general.
     The report says right-wing mobsters were used in the 1980s for state operations at home and abroad, given gun licenses and special passports normally used by top level civil servants.
     These mobsters later began to use the privileges for their own work, including the drug trade, gun-running, money-laundering, armed robbery, extortion, corruption in state auctions, mediating between bureaucrats and the prostitution and gambling sectors and bribery. State workers turned a blind eye or helped them, the report said.
     In the 1990s, organized crime spread to the southeast, taking advantage of a state of emergency and a system of state-paid village guards set up to help the army in its 12-year fight against the rebel Kurdistan Workers Party.
     The report said many state officials have hidden their activities as "state secrets."
     The report's recommendations include sweeping legal reform, limiting MPs' immunity from prosecution, reforming laws that restrict legal action against state employees, abolishing or reforming the village guard system and finding an alternative to emergency rule in the southeast.
     It also calls for a review of methods used to fight the guerrillas in order to prevent criminal gain from the insurgency.
     Parliament, however, is not bound by the commission's recommendations.

	  UN: Colombia's human rights situation marked by ...

OTC  4/2/97 11:49 PM  

 APR  2, 1997, M2 Communications - The human rights situation in  Colombia was marked by abuses from the Government's security forces,  the corrupting power of drug trafficking, frequent violations by  guerrillas groups, and serious criminal acts carried out by  paramilitary forces, the Human Rights Committee's expert member from  Ecuador said this afternoon. He was commenting on Colombia's fourth  periodic report on its compliance with the International Covenant on  Civil and Political Rights. 
   According to the Andean Commission of Jurists, paramilitary forces in  Colombia acted with the acquiescence of State security forces in  carrying out summary executions, disappearances, torture and other  human rights violations, he added. For all practical purposes, there  was no guarantee of the right to life in Colombia. What was the  Government actually going to do to address one of the most serious  problems in Latin America today? he asked. 
   Concern was also expressed about the military justice system in  Colombia. The expert from the United States, for example, said many  instances of killings, disappearances and torture were investigated  very effectively. Yet, just when those efforts seemed to be leading to  results, the cases were transferred to military tribunals, where very  little happened. It seemed to be an institutionalized system to protect  impunity, he said. 
   Addressing the conduct of states of emergency, the expert from  Australia said Colombia's Constitutional Court had found one such state  to have been inconsistent with the Constitution, and that the powers of  arrest without warrant had been unconstitutional. What was disturbing  was that the Government's response had been to aim at limiting the  power of the Court to address such questions. 
   Many experts expressed the view that Colombia's report failed to  adequately reflect the situation in the country or to address the  concerns raised by the Committee in response to the country's prior  report. The expert from Australia said that, while the current report  referred to the Committee's previous recommendations on such issues as  "faceless justice" and the operation of military tribunals, it had  failed to follow up on them. 
   Comments and questions were also presented by the experts from Egypt,  Chile, Germany, India, United Kingdom, Mauritius and Canada. At the  outset of the meeting, representatives from Colombia completed their  replies to questions that had been submitted in writing by the  Committee. 
   The Human Rights Committee will meet again at 10 a.m. Tuesday, 1  April, to continue its consideration of Colombia's report. 
          Committee Work Programme 
   The Committee on Human Rights met this afternoon to continue  examination of the fourth periodic report of Colombia (document  CCPR/C/103/Add.3) on its compliance with the International Covenant on  Civil and Political Rights. 
          Response of Colombia 
   Resuming Colombia's response to written questions from the Committee,  CARLOS VICENTI DE ROUX, Presidential Adviser on Human Rights, said that  where there was no agreement on compensation in a human rights abuse  case, the case was liquidated. 
   FELIPE PIQUERO VILLEGAS, Minister Counsellor of Colombia, said seven  out of 18 cases on compensation had been decided upon favourably and  payments of compensation were made in accordance with existing law. The  largest number of complaints were made against the armed forces.  Responding to questions about organizations and agencies concerned  about human rights issues, he said that Colombia had an Office of  Public Defender, headed by a private person, who made recommendations  to the Government on violations or threats to human rights. His  functions were independent, and he could exercise habeas corpus on  behalf of individuals. The Office of Public Defender had dealt with  more than 42,000 cases, of which more than 25,000 concerned violations  of human rights. The Office dealt with all kinds of human rights  violations, including abuse of authority by security forces and  government officials. 
   A Commission on Human Rights was established in 1994 on an  experimental basis following negotiations between the Government and a  guerrilla group that had demobilized its forces. The Commission  included the Presidential Adviser on Human Rights, the Public  Prosecutor, the Attorney-General, the Ombudsman and non-governmental  organizations. Its task was to process and analyse issues and to  recommend programmes and actions. It had worked for more than a year  and developed a number of recommendations, but it ceased functioning  following the withdrawal of its non-governmental organization  representatives, who were protesting emergency measures taken by the  Government at the end of 1995. 
   He said the prosecutor's department had also established the National  Human Rights Procurators Unit, whose purpose was to speed up  investigations into serious human rights violations, such as torture  and extrajudicial executions. The human rights unit had branches  throughout the country and operated on 24-hour basis to hear complaints  and investigate rights violations. A bill had been introduced in the  Colombian Congress to ensure that there were no undue delays in the  adjudication of human rights cases in the Supreme Court. 
          Comments and Questions 
   JULIO PRADO VALLEJO, expert from Ecuador, said he looked forward to  the opportunity to consider one of the most serious problems taking  place in Latin America today. In a situation that was of such a threat  to peace in Colombia, why was it that international mediation had not  been sought? Why was it that internal mechanisms had been unable to  achieve peace through negotiations involving other Latin American  countries? The situation in Colombia was very grave and affected the  entire region, particularly those countries which shared its borders.  All were familiar with the situation in Colombia, which involved  torture, disappearances, summary executions and open violations of  human rights, he said. Particularly striking were the abuses  perpetrated by the security forces, the corrupting power of drug  trafficking, and the frequent violation of international human rights  by the guerrillas. Perhaps most serious were the criminal actions  perpetrated by paramilitary forces. 
   While abuses in the past focused on the security forces, they now  centred on the paramilitary forces, he said. It had been reported that  while 10 per cent of the violations were perpetrated by the military,  60 per cent were by the paramilitary and 27 per cent by the guerrillas.  Many of those murdered by the paramilitary forces were found to have  been the victims of severe torture. However, there had been no  punishment of individuals found guilty. 
   He said special public order security areas had been created within  Colombia, where security forces were authorized to detain people and to  go into their homes without any judicial warrants. As a result, the  military forces could carry out their struggle against the insurgency  without any legal constraints. The absence of such limitations on the  military forces was the key problem Colombia was facing in that sphere. 
   For all practical purposes, there was no guarantee of the right to  life in Colombia, he said. There were some 1,100 kidnappings annually  and they involved the participation not only of the paramilitary  forces, but of the State's own security forces, as well. The Andean  Commission of Jurists had stated that the paramilitary forces acted  with the acquiescence of State security forces in carrying out summary  executions, disappearances, torture and other human rights violations. 
   Since it was the State of Colombia that had signed the Covenant, what  did it plan to do to overcome the current situation? he asked. The  President had put forward a minimum agenda to address the problem.  However, it was one thing to "humanize" war and quite another to  prevent armed forces from being involved with the paramilitary and  fostering its aggressive acts of violence. In view of the close  relationship between the paramilitary and the Government's own security  forces, what was the Government going to do? 
   ELIZABETH EVATT, expert from Australia, said the report of Colombia  was disappointing. Although it was heavy with references to the laws,  it provided too little information on the actual problems being faced  in Colombia. It was also disappointing as a fourth report, conveying no  sense of change, development or continuity. It referred to the  Committee's previous recommendations, but did not follow up on them,  particularly with respect to such issues as "faceless justice" and the  operation of military tribunals. 
   The Committee sought to ensure that Colombia complied with the  provisions governing states of emergency, she said. The Constitutional  Court found one declaration of emergency to have been inconsistent with  the Constitution, and that the powers of arrest without warrant had  been unconstitutional. What was disturbing was that the Government's  response aimed at limiting the role of the Constitutional Court with  respect to such questions. What was being done to ensure that states of  emergency complied with Covenant standards? 
   The report made no mention of the threats to and deaths of trade  union members, said to originate from the paramilitary with support  from the security forces, she said. Also, the report did not address  the Committee's concerns with respect to impunity. Although all  allegations of human rights violations should be brought within the  competence of the ordinary courts, military jurisdiction had expanded  to some extent, so as to include rape and charges of collaboration with  paramilitaries. That was very damaging with respect to accountability.  She also cited a particular case on which the Committee had expressed  its concern, but which was not addressed in Colombia's report. 
   OMRAN EL-SHAFEI, expert from Egypt, said Colombia's reports did not  give adequate information on the results of actions taken to ensure  compliance with Covenant provisions. A great deal of information had  been provided from non- governmental organizations, both within and  outside Colombia, on the situation in the country. The United States  State Department annual report on Colombia had also been quite helpful. 
   He said Colombia's report cited the Government's policy to establish  peace and social harmony and its willingness to conduct negotiations  with armed insurgent groups in the absence of prior conditions. It also  stated that Colombia's human rights commission was in recess owing to  the withdrawal by non-governmental organizations -- an action taken in  protest of government emergency measures. He requested further  information on that matter. 
   While the report indicated that exceptions to the Covenant could be  taken in conditions of foreign war, internal disturbance and states of  emergency, it did not indicate the rights for which derogation was  permitted. He requested further clarification. Information was also  needed on proposed amendments that would strip the Constitutional Court  of its powers to review certain governmental decisions. Was that  proposal still active? He also requested information on a proposal  regarding the issuance of arrest warrants. 
   What measures had the Government taken to ensure that armed forces  within the regional system were not carrying out arrests in violation  of the Colombian Constitution and of the Covenant? he asked. It had  become a matter of practice for the military to detain individuals  within military installations while awaiting transfer to civilian  facilities. There were many reports of intimidation and torture in the  military facilities. Could the Government confirm those reports? 
   THOMAS BUERGENTHAL, expert from the United States, said he agreed  with the criticisms of Colombia's report, as expressed by his  colleagues on the Committee. It was striking that there were a large  number of killings, disappearances and torture that were being  investigated very effectively, but just when they seemed to be leading  to some result the cases were transferred to military tribunals. It  seemed as if some sort of game was being played, since very little  happened once a case reached the military tribunals. It seemed to be an  institutionalized system to protect impunity. Why had the legislature  now made it even easier to refer even more cases to the military  tribunals? 
   He asked for additional information on the constitution of the  military tribunals. The delegations had apparently stated that active  military officers were now permitted to sit on such tribunals, and  could even be in the direct line of command of those being tried. How  could such a practice be compatible with Colombia's Covenant  obligations, when the judges themselves might be found responsible, by  implication, if the officers were convicted? 
   Although it had been stated that there was now a possibility of  appeal to the Supreme Court, it seemed to be a very limited  improvement, he said. How did a civilian who was detained by the  military get to a civilian court to challenge that detention? How did  that work in practice? How many people actually did that and were  successful in doing so? 
   He drew attention to efforts being made to limit the powers of the  Constitutional Court, including its powers to rule on the  constitutionality of a state of siege. How did such a measure ensure  the protection of human rights in Colombia? It had been stated that  disciplinary measures could be taken against a "faceless judge" who  should have removed himself from a case, but did not. How serious a  protection was that when the attorneys did not know the identity of the  judge? 
   That entire method of proceeding was very problematic and should be  very limited, he said. Although the problems that had given rise to it  were understood, serious thought should be given to protecting the  human rights of those concerned. Why were such infamous leaders of  paramilitary units as Carlos Castano still free, even though his  encampment was apparently right next to a military encampment? While  praising Colombia's system of compensation, he asked for additional  information as to whether compensation rulings could be overruled. 
   CECILIA MEDINA QUIROGA, expert from Chile, congratulated the  Government on a number of positive steps, such as the compensation law.  She, however, expressed disappointment with the Colombian report. The  Government had permitted some military personnel guilty of human rights  violations to escape, and she was disappointed with the introduction of  a new military code, noting that there was no need for separate  military justice. Noting the multiplicity of governmental bodies  dealing with human rights issues, she asked how their work was  coordinated and how the public lodged complaints about rights  violations. 
   ECKART KLEIN, expert from Germany, said there were indications that  human rights problems were on the increase, although some positive  gains had been made. He feared the state of law could be dealt a  serious blow in the future. The Colombian report was unbalanced in many  respects. Non- governmental organizations were reporting that Colombia  continued to maintain the worst human rights record in the western  hemisphere. There were certain institutional developments that could  lead to a further erosion of human rights. Violence had contaminated  all parts of society, including the State. 
   He drew attention to the fact that states of emergency were always,  by nature, very unfavourable for the enjoyment of human rights,  notwithstanding provisions in the Constitution about protection of  rights. He called for an explanation about the restriction of the right  of assembly during states of emergency. He said the structure of the  military itself, even if its members were very well-trained, made it  unsuitable for the administration of justice. He had the impression  that the greater the number of institutions working for human rights,  the less those rights were protected. Colombia could be congratulated  for accepting obligations under the Covenant, but it did not seem to be  complying with it. Open criticism of the situation was what was most  needed. 
   PRAFULLACHANDRA BHAGWATI, expert from India, also expressed  disappointment with the report, noting that it did not seem to reflect  the true state of affairs in the country. The Committee had received a  large amount of credible information from non-governmental  organizations, indicating that all was not well in Colombia. There were  reports of arbitrary arrests, extrajudicial executions, and an  inadequate judiciary system, as well as reports on the activities of  paramilitary groups. 
   He was disturbed by attempts to limit the powers of the  Constitutional Court and vesting powers in the President to declare a  state of exception. That power should be limited, he said. The  existence of military courts violated provisions of the Covenant. He  questioned the system of anonymous judges presiding over courts, and  welcomed the statement that it would be reviewed in 1999. He would like  to know whether convicted prisoners could work for private enterprises  and the terms for such activity. He also asked about the requirements  for the establishment of trade unions. 
   Lord JOHN MARK ALEXANDER COLVILLE, expert from the United Kingdom,  said that, admirable though the system of compensation was, he wondered  why it took such a long time for payments to be made. On another  matter, he said that crimes could only be reduced if the potential  criminal expected to be caught, tried and dealt with expeditiously.  Speed was very important in the administration of justice. Was it true  that two months elapsed before cases were brought to trial? Did that  apply, as well, in military courts? He also sought information on the  backlog of cases still outstanding. 
   He suggested that Colombia could learn from the United Kingdom's  experience in the operation of the court martial system. He commended  the new system established by the Government to protect judges. He  would like to see some of the most positive aspects of the Government's  proposals on strengthening human rights put into effect immediately. 
   RAJSOOMER LALLAH, expert from Mauritius, said the report did not  follow the guidelines established for the writing of such reports, and  had not dealt with some of the issues raised by the Committee after the  submission of the third periodic report. Information he had received  showed little or no progress in the human rights situation. If  anything, it was now worse. The military was slowly taking over  civilian judiciary powers. Threats were being made against a number of  institutions and decisions of the courts. He found it unacceptable that  the Government should question the merits of cases dealt with under the  Optional Protocol. 
   MAXWELL YALDEN, expert from Canada, said the multiplicity of  institutions in the area of human rights were impressive, but he  wondered how effective they were in promoting and protecting human  rights. How were members of those organizations appointed and how were  the institutions financed? he asked. There were no indications that  those institutions met the criteria established by international human  rights norms. He also asked what mechanisms existed for dealing with  human rights problems.

	 UN: Magnitude of paramilitary activity in Colombia ...

OTC  4/3/97 12:09 AM  

 APR  2, 1997, M2 Communications - The magnitude of paramilitarism in  Colombia and its barbarism was astounding, Presidential Adviser on  Human Rights Carlos Vicenti de Roux said this morning, as the Human  Rights Committee continued its consideration of his country's fourth  periodic report on its compliance with the International Covenant on  Civil and Political Rights. 
   In Colombia, he said, there was a conflict between two sources of  barbarism -- paramilitarism, on the one hand, and the guerrillas, on  the other. The guerrillas employed such measures as kidnapping,  extortion and robbery to advance their aims. At the same time,  paramilitary groups -- which engaged in massacres and forced  disappearances -- were supported by livestock raisers, ranchers,  landholders and the poor in many parts of the country. 
   The State faced enormous difficulties in guaranteeing the rights and  dignity of the citizens, he said. How could it fight the guerrillas,  who extracted resources from the population in order to build their war  machine, without diverting scarce funds from essential social services?  It needed to fight paramilitarism and ensure security against the  guerrillas. If the authorities could not provide security, the public  would continue to seek protection from the paramilitarists. 
   Among other issues addressed today by Colombia's delegation were  measures that could be taken under states of emergency, the military  justice system, gender equality, remedies for violence against women  and children, the protection of minors, and efforts relating to  Colombia's indigenous populations. 
   The Committee's experts from the United Kingdom, Ecuador, Chile,  Canada, Australia and India posed questions and offered comments on  Colombia's report. 
   The Human Rights Committee will meet again at 3 p.m. today to  conclude its consideration of Colombia's fourth periodic report. 
          Committee Work Programme 
   The Human Rights Committee met this morning to continue its  consideration of the fourth periodic report of Colombia (document  CCPR/C/103/Add.3) on measures the country has taken to implement the  provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
          Questions from Experts 
   Lord JOHN MARK ALEXANDER COLVILLE, expert from the United Kingdom,  citing two cases communicated to the Committee under its Optional  Protocol, asked why the Colombian authorities had not acted quickly on  the Committee's recommendations. He noted that it was another example  of delays in the implementation of decisions on human rights issues.  [Under the Optional Protocol of the Covenant, individuals claiming  rights violations could make representations to the Committee.] 
          Response from Colombia 
   FELIPE PIQUERO VILLEGAS, Minister Counsellor of Colombia, responding  to comments and issues raised at the Committee's meeting yesterday,  said that a State body -- the Committee of Ministers -- reviewed cases  in which claims for compensation were made. 
   CARLOS MALAGON, Deputy Minister of Justice of Colombia, said  decisions of regional judges could be monitored by higher judicial  bodies. There would be gradual dismantling of the "faceless courts", he  said. [Judges presiding over those courts were not seen and their names  remained unknown.] 
   He, said states of emergency were governed by constitutional and  statutory law. Many rights, including the right to life, were  considered inviolable in states of emergency. There was also provision  for a suspension of rights, which could not be so serious as to result  in the denial of fundamental rights and freedoms. A state of emergency  decree must clearly state the reason for the measures to be taken. That  made it possible to analyse the relevance and proportionality of those  measures, which were permitted only in order to bring about a return to  normalcy. 
   For as long as the new Constitution has been in force, the measures  adopted during a state of emergency had not gone beyond what would be  considered acceptable, he said. During that period, there had been no  complaints of possible violations of individual human rights resulting  from application of states of emergency. Members of the public forces  were much more cautious, for example, in such matters as seizures and  detentions. Criminal activities had been prevented through the timely  use of states of emergency. 
   KAREN KUFHELDT, Adviser in the Office of the Minister of the  Interior, said judicial monitoring of a state of emergency decree was  not defined as an explicit power under the Constitution. However, it  had become a part of Colombia's jurisprudence. There was no unanimity  in the Constitutional Court on the appropriateness of that power. The  Constitution itself considered the Congress to be the competent body to  review the state of emergency. 
   Addressing the question of impunity, Mr. MALAGON, Deputy Minister of  Justice, cited a study that indicated a high degree of hidden  criminality in Colombia. The Attorney-General's office was doing its  best to ensure that trials presented to it were heard. 
   Expressing concern about the violent situation in his country, CARLOS  VICENTI DE ROUX, Presidential Adviser on Human Rights, said Colombia's  delegation would give serious consideration to the Committee's views.  The magnitude of paramilitarism in Colombia and its barbarism was  astounding. It was supported by livestock raisers, ranchers and  landholders in many parts of the country. It was also supported by the  poor peasantry, and strengthened by the phenomenon of drug trafficking. 
   In Colombia, he said, there was a conflict between two sources of  barbarism -- paramilitarism, on the one hand, and the guerrillas, on  the other. The guerrillas employed such measures as kidnapping,  extortion and robbery to advance their aims. Their activities  represented a blow against nearly all segments of Colombian society. No  other group committed as many kidnappings as did the guerrillas in  Colombia. 
   "Where is the State in all of this"? he asked. The duty of the State  was to guarantee the rights and dignity of the citizens, but the State  had enormous difficulties in attempting to impose social discipline.  How could it fight guerrillas who extracted resources from the  population in order to build their war machine without diverting scarce  funds from essential social services? The guerrillas not only went into  a region and extracted its resources, they also ripped its social  fabric. 
   There were three things that must be done, he said. First, the  Government had to fight back against paramilitarism and its horrible  expressions including massacres and continued forced disappearances.  Second, the outcry for security against the guerrillas must be  addressed. Public safety must be ensured by the public authorities.  Otherwise, the public would seek protection from the paramilitarists.  Finally, pressure must be maintained on the guerrillas, including  international pressure. 
   Commenting on military criminal justice, he said the Government had  problems in dealing with the military justice system in cases of human  rights violations. Unsuccessful attempts were made in the past by some  members of the Colombian Congress to involve civilians in the military  criminal justice system. Attempts were being made to reform the  military criminal code. The Government faced many challenges and had to  approach the problems gradually. It needed the assistance of  international human rights bodies. The established democratic  institutions must be preserved. 
   Turning to the many official bodies dealing with human rights issues  raised by the experts, he said that they were small and more were  required. Those bodies had specific and clearly defined functions. Some  were involved in public education on human rights issues. Military  officers who committed major human rights violations were removed from  office. The Government was trying to pull together all democratic  forces, as well as use international assistance, to move the country  forward in the area of human rights. 
   Questions from Experts JULIO PRADO VALLEJO, expert from Ecuador,  commended the efforts of the Government to break links between the  military and paramilitary forces. He said that having recognized the  competence of the Committee, the Government must uphold the Committee's  decisions on communications brought before it under the Covenant's  Optional Protocol. 
          Colombia's Response 
   Mr. DE ROUX, Presidential Adviser on Human Rights, responding again  to comments on compensation, said the Government was bound by decisions  of the Committee of Ministers regarding payments of compensations. The  Government would act on recommendations of the Committee of Ministers  that compensations should be paid in four of the eight cases referred  to it. 
   Ms. KUFHELDT, Adviser in the Office of the Minister of the Interior,  responding to questions on part two of the list of issues brought up by  the Committee, said that there were provisions in Colombia's laws  guaranteeing real gender equality. Gender perspectives were being  adopted in all aspects of State action. A government study had found  that women were not given favourable sentences in the courts and that  men were given quicker trials than women. Prejudices still permeated  the justice system. There were fewer women judges, and their  participation in the higher courts were low. 
   She said that much remained to be done in introducing a gender  perspective to many areas of Colombian national life. An affirmative  action law had been enacted to improve the situation of women in all  spheres, including those heading households. The latter had been given  priority in access to credit, home ownership and land allocation.  Employment and educational opportunities were also open to them. The  Government was carrying out educational programmes to make the public  and institutions aware of gender equality. School textbooks were being  changed to address the issue of gender equality. In addition, a  national registry had been established to compile information on people  responsible for child support. 
   Mr. MALAGON, Deputy Minister of Justice, said legal aid was provided.  Students from law faculties of the universities were helping to provide  legal aid and free interpretation to those who could not afford legal  representation. 
   Ms. KUFHELDT, Adviser in the Office of the Minister of the Interior,  said remedies were provided for violence in the household against women  and minors. Several institutions had joined to promote the rights of  the child and guarantee and expand the scope of education of children  and adolescents. A national plan of action for children was helping to  protect them and those subjected to high risk. Abused children were  also helped. Regional centres were being set up to help children. A  large number of children were involved in the various armed conflicts  in the country, and attempts were being made to provide them with  alternative interests. 
   Long- and short-term socio-economic programmes had been designed to  provide jobs for displaced children, she said. She had no specific  figures on the number of street children, but said that forced  displacements had increased their number. Most street children were  boys, and many had left at eight or nine years of age. They had no  family bonds. A network of institutions had also been established to  help street children. 
   Mr. DE ROUX, Presidential Adviser on Human Rights, drew attention to  agreements reached with the guerrillas prohibiting their recruitment of  children of thirteen or fourteen years of age. Also, a bill submitted  by the Ministry of Defence would prohibit the recruitment in the  military of minors under the age of eighteen. Currently, a minor must  receive the permission of a family member to work, and that for a  limited number of hours. Employment under the age of twelve was  prohibited. An employer could be punished for hiring a minor without  the required permission, either through a fine or closure of the  business. 
   Ms. KUFHELDT, Adviser in the Office of the Minister of the Interior,  said a great deal needed to be done to address the needs of Colombia's  ethnic communities. There was a programme of education for 80 per cent  of the indigenous population, but it did not take account of their  social and cultural features. There were also very high illiteracy  rates among the indigenous peoples. Efforts were under way to address  that problem and expand education coverage. 
   She said health centres were being established and training provided  on health assistance for indigenous groups. With respect to  landholding, 410 special areas had been established for the indigenous  peoples, but there were some problems associated with those areas.  Indigenous jurisdictions had been recognized and protected by the  courts and were supported by the Government. Actions were being taken  to acknowledge the administrative rights of the indigenous peoples. 
   She said the country had faced difficulties and obstacles with  respect to addressing the needs of Colombia's African communities.  However, progress had been possible in the area of political  representation and the defence of black rights. Nevertheless, a great  deal remained to be done. 
   On a question that had been submitted with respect to question of  stateless children of refugees born in Colombia, Mr. DE ROUX,  Presidential Adviser on Human Rights, said Colombian nationality was  not granted when people were not expected to remain in the country. 
          Experts' Questions and Comments 
   Lord COLVILLE, expert from the United Kingdom, asked whether the  authorities had spelt out the public sectors that could not adopt  strike action. 
   CECILIA MEDINA QUIROGA, expert from Chile, commenting on the response  of the delegation to gender equality issues, said that there should be  campaigns on alternative methods of right to life. She quoted from a  document which said that in 1989, 70,000 women were hospitalized in  Colombia for the purposes of abortion. She noted that non-Catholic  educational institutions were requested to introduce Catholic religious  education before receiving Government grants. 
   MAXWELL YALDEN, expert from Canada, said that cultural factors worked  against women as indicated in the Colombian report. Statistics produced  by the delegation showed some progress in the employment of women. He  would, however, like to know whether affirmative action programmes were  in place to ensure employment of women and to address the problems of  Colombia's black population. He found the problems of the black and  indigenous communities disturbing. The stated objectives and programmes  of the Government would have to be seen in practice before judgements  could be made. 
   ELIZABETH EVATT, expert from Australia, stressed that the Colombian  Government must respect the rule of law, must act in accordance with  international human rights instruments, and apply justice equally to  everyone. She reiterated the points made yesterday; there was a gap  between the promises of action by the Government and the reality of the  situation on the ground. There was no evidence of real changes taking  place in the country. 
   PRAFULLACHANDRA NATWARLAL BHAGWATI, expert from India, asked who  provided the defence lawyer for Colombia's legal aid programme. Did a  person also get aid in civil cases, or only in criminal cases? The  Committee had information that 22 per cent of all recruits in  Colombia's Army were under the age of eighteen. Was that true? The bill  to raise the age for recruitment in the military and the agreement with  the guerrilla groups were welcome. 
   Were children in Colombia being taken in adoption by foreign parents?  he asked. If so, were there any laws to safeguard their interests?  There was a staggering number of child workers -- 15 to 20 per cent of  all children in Colombia. What steps were being taken to implement  Colombia's child labour law through inspections? What fines were being  imposed? Were there any restrictions placed on the activities of trade  unions?

   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- This family friendly tourist city has become a mecca for a more hedonistic group of fun seekers -- young people looking for all-night dance parties where illicit drug use is common.
   Orlando, home of Disney World, is seeing an increase in "raves," thanks to a growing work force of young people who get off late and want some place to party.
   City officials believe things are getting out of hand and have formed a task force to explore ways to keep the party going without the use of LSD, Ecstasy and methamphetamines.
   "Overdoses have become a problem," said Orlando police Capt. Sal Lomonaco, a member of the mayor's Rave Review Task Force.
   Raves drew national attention when dozens of young people were sickened on New Year's Eve after consuming an herbal drink at an all-night party in Los Angeles. The maker of the drink stopped producing the concoction after a warning from federal officials.
   The rave task force in Orlando was to meet for the first time today. Among the suggestions to tame the parties: police-sponsored raves or all-night dances held by churches.
   And Orlando isn't the only Florida city cracking down.
   In Tallahassee, lawmakers are considering a bill that would prohibit nightclubs and bars from staying open past last call at 2 a.m. Violators could face a misdemeanor charge and lose their liquor license.
   The bill is modeled after an ordinance passed by Tampa last year. The Orlando City Council has endorsed the idea.
   Club owners -- even those who don't hold raves -- are vehemently opposed.
   "A big part of the a dance club attraction is how late we stay open," said John Gardner, owner of Barberella, a downtown club. "Staying open allows our customers extra time to sober up on our dance floor."
   Orlando nightclubs began holding raves about two years ago. Before that, the parties had been held secretly for years at warehouses or open fields.
   "It's dance, dance, dance," said Michael Torres, 28, a graphic designer, who has been to several Orlando raves. "The music and the people are ready to explode."
   Pulsating synthesized music, elaborate lighting and drugs are all part of the scene. Most of the drug activity is done secretly out of fear of undercover cops and security guards.
   Compared to New York and New Jersey, where rave-goers sometimes openly use heroin, the drug usage at Orlando raves is much tamer, Torres said. Ravers in Orlando frequently use LSD, animal tranquilizers, marijuana, Rohypnol and Ecstasy.
   Orlando police have conducted undercover operations at the clubs, making 26 arrests four months ago. But catching people buying and selling drugs is difficult, Lomonaco said.
   "It's done carefully and secretly," he said.
   Club owners said they don't tolerate drug use and have worked with police to combat it.
   However, there is only so much that can be done, said Jon Marsa, owner of the Club of Firestone in downtown.
   "Any nightclub owner on this planet that tells you drugs is absent from his club is lying," he said.

OPIUM production is soaring in Afghanistan as farmers benefit from the relative security that the Islamic fundamentalist Taliban movement has brought.
The Taliban, which controls two-thirds of the country, has imposed a strict ban on hashish growing. But it has not banned production of the poppies from which opium and heroin are made.
Taliban leaders say hashish is consumed by Afghans and is therefore anti-Islamic. But as opium is exported to the West and there is no cash crop alternative for farmers, there is no urgent need to ban poppy growing.
"We let people cultivate poppies because farmers get good prices," said Abdul Rashid, head of the Taliban's drug control unit at his office in Kandahar. Rashid, who wears a flowing black turban and a long beard, has a 10-man force which was set up a few months ago.
"We cannot push the people to grow wheat," he added. "There would be an uprising against the Taliban if we forced them to stop poppy cultivation."
Mohammed Hassan, the Governor of Kandahar, who is the movement's second-ranking leader, said: "Drugs are evil and we would like to substitute poppies with another cash crop, but it's not possible at the moment."
The Taliban's ban on production of hashish, traditionally consumed by millions of Afghans, already seems to be taking effect. Hundreds of sacks of hashish are stored in two warehouses at the police headquarters after being confiscated from growers and dealers.
The Taliban also has a novel approach to hashish addiction. "When we catch hashish smugglers or addicts we beat them to find out the truth," said Abdul Rashid. "Then we put them in cold water for hours, three times a day. It's a good cure."
In the presence of Mr Rashid, several prisoners readily agreed that the Taliban's shock therapy was effective. "When I am beaten or in the cold water I forget all about hashish," said Bakth Mohammed, a former shopkeeper who is serving three months in jail.
Last year, Afghanistan produced an estimated 2,300 tons of opium, rivalling Burma as the world's largest producer of the raw drug. Afghan dealers as well as those from Pakistan, Iran and Turkmenistan, buy the raw opium and refine it into heroin for export.
Officials of the United Nations Drug Control Programme told of a "staggering increase" in production. For example, in one area, 120 tons of opium was harvested from 874 acres of poppy fields last year. The previous year, 79 tons was produced from 995 acres.
Just two miles from Kandahar city centre, poppy fields stretch as far as the horizon. Farmers have brought in fertiliser and tractors from Pakistan to increase yields. Old irrigation channels, destroyed during the war against Soviet occupation in the 1980s, are being rapidly restored.
"The Taliban has brought us security so we can grow poppies in peace," said Wali Jan, a farmer, as he weeded his field of still-green poppy plants. "How can I support my 14 family members if I don't do it?"
On his small plot of land, Wali Jan produces about 45 kg of raw opium from two crops every year and earns about L850. Refined heroin fetches 50 times that price in London or New York.
Mud homes are being rapidly rebuilt in villages around Kandahar from the proceeds. The trade is a huge incentive after the devastation of 18 years of war.
"I have stopped growing hashish because the Taliban has forbidden it," said another farmer, Abdul Karim. "When the Taliban leaders ask us to stop growing poppies, we will obey their command."
The Taliban is angry that the world has still not recognised its government, even though it controls most of Afghanistan and the capital, Kabul.
Mr Hassan said: "The UN must recognise our government because we control 75 per cent of the country and we respect human rights."
A Taliban soldier, Abdul Mateen, said: "If the West will support the Islamic demands of the Taliban and recognise our government then we can stop this poppy cultivation."
The lack of recognition means that international aid from Western drugs control agencies is virtually non-existent. "This office should be supported with equipment from foreign countries to control drugs," said Mr Rashid. "But I have only 10 men and a scooter to chase hashish smugglers."
The Taliban's refusal to share power with other factions and its discrimination against women has been a major factor in the failure of Western and Muslim countries to recognise it.
But now the growth in opium production is causing concern in Western capitals.

01Apr97 CZECH REPUBLIC:  MYSTERIOUS INVESTOR VYMYSLICKY LIVES IN CANADA.
NEW YORK, April 1 (CTK) - Mysterious investor Pavel Vymyslicky, who has recently raised the Cetrans forwarding company's share capital by Kc680m, has been living in Canada for fifteen years, he told CTK in New York after returning from a visit to the Czech Republic.
He declined to disclose more about himself. He just said he was engaged in trading.
The increase of Cetrans' share capital was investigated by the police, and there were rumours in banking circles that money laundering might be involved. The case aroused suspicions because the Czech National Bank (CNB) recorded no such big transaction at the time when the money was to be sent to Cetrans by Vymyslicky.
In addition, Vymyslicky's compatriots in Kitchener, Ontario, said he could not have possessed such a big sum.
The Kitchener chamber of commerce knows nothing about Vymyslicky, nor does the Czech-Canadian chamber of commerce, which registers 5,000 business people.
Cetrans board chairman Ivan Domecky said recently that Vymyslicky had proved his identity at a notary and had proceeded in harmony with the law. Vymyslicky was also registered by the Central Securities Registry (SCP). Vymyslicky's shares, representing 36-percent of the increased share capital, are registered regularly, Domecky added.

03Apr97 SCHWEIZ: VIRTUELL BEZAHLEN - DIGITALES GELD.
Von Markus Stolz.
Bargeld wird bald uberflussig: Die Wahrung von morgen besteht aus Bits und Bytes. Die Kunden sind dabei vor allem am Service und der Sicherheit der neuen Zahlungsmethode interessiert.
 
In der Wirtschaft beherrscht bereits heute elektronisches Geld (E-Cash) das Geschaft. Harte Munzen und bunte Scheine machen nur noch einen winzigen Bruchteil der kursierenden Geldmenge aus pro Kopf in der Schweiz nicht mehr als 2500 Fr. im Jahr. Sollte sich nach Direct-Banking auch On-line-Shopping durchsetzen, durfte der elektronische Zahlungsverkehr in Zukunft noch starker uber die Computernetze laufen. Auf mehr als 600 Mrd Dollar schatzt das US-Marktforschungsinstitut Forrester den Handelsumsatz in internationalen Netzen fur das Jahr 2000. Ein allgemein anerkanntes Zahlungsmittel ist alles, was zum digitalen Wirtschaftswunder noch fehlt.
Einer Aufstellung des amerikanischen Financial Services Technology Consortium (FSTC) zufolge schalt sich dabei eine Struktur heraus, die sich weitgehend an dem etablierten Geldverkehrssystem orientiert: Homebanking ersetzt Schalterauftrage, Electronic-Cash dient zur Barzahlung beim Teleshopping und Kreditkarten-Transaktionen funktionieren wie bisher nur elektronisch. War das Geschaft mit Digitalgeld jedoch bislang die Domane der Banken, rutteln mittlerweile immer mehr Privatfirmen am Finanzmonopol.
 
Katalysator fur den Markt
 
First Virtual, Visa, Mastercard, CyberCash, DigiCash oder Mondex gleich in Scharen strengen sich Unternehmen und Organisationen vor allem in den USA an, um das Netz mit Zahlungsmitteln zu versorgen. <E-cash ist Katalysator zur Schaffung eines ganzen Marktes im Cyberspace. Es macht Datennetze interessant fur einen riesigen Personenkreis. Vorhersagen kann ich nicht treffen. Aber das wird richtig gross>, verkundet David Chaum, Chef der Firma Digicash und Erfinder der Digitalwahrung <E-cash>.
 
Weitreichende Folgen
 
Es gibt viele Ideen fur das elektronische Geld doch grundsatzlich zeichnen sich zwei Formen ab: Computerkonten oder Geld auf Chipkarten. Wahrend die First Virtual Bank ihr System an herkommliche Kreditkarten koppelt, propagieren Firmen wie Digicash und Cybercash frei fliessende Bit-Wahrungen fur das Internet. Welches Geld sich in der virtuellen Welt durchsetzt, hat auch weitreichende Folgen im realen Leben: Fur die Datensicherheit, fur die Kontrolle der Zentralbanken uber die Geldmenge und die Zukunft des klassischen Bankgeschafts.
Beinahe wochentlich verkunden Privatbanken, Softwarehauser und Kreditkartenunternehmen Plane und Entwicklungen fur den elektronischen Geldbeutel und rutteln am monetaren Standard. Und die Konkurrenz wird grosser. <Heute kann sich ein Anbieter von Finanzdienstleistungen schon fur 160 000 Fr. im Internet plazieren>, weiss Volkswirtschaftlerin Christiane Fotschki, wissenschaftliche Mitarbeiterin des Instituts fur Bankinformatik (ibi) an der Universitat im deutschen Regensburg.
<Digitales Geld steht fur monetare Freiheit. Zum ersten Mal uberhaupt sind Individuen in der Lage, einen neuen Wertstandard zu schaffen>, meint Jon Matonis, Grunder und Direktor der kalifornischen Forschungseinrichtung Private Payment Systems. Alarmzeichen fur Regierungen und Zentralbanken: Stephen Horwitz, Wirtschaftsprofessor an der St. Lawrence University in New York, ist davon uberzeugt, dass Digitalgeld auch nationalen Notenbanken wie der US Federal Reserve den Boden unter den Fussen wegziehen konnte. So bringt die heraufziehende Digitalisierung des Zahlungsverkehrs ebenso eine Globalisierung als auch eine Privatisierung des Geldgeschaftes mit sich. Viele bankspezifische Dienstleistungen konnten kunftig auch andere Unternehmen erbringen, glaubt Howard Anderson, Prasident des US-Beratungsunternehmens Yankee Group: <Banking braucht jeder aber nicht Banken.>
Dennoch sind die Chancen der alternativen Anbieter eher gering, mehr als nur einen Bruchteil des Geldverkehrs auf dem Internet zu kontrollieren. Denn schon heute zahlt die Mehrheit der On-line-Kunden mit Kreditkarte. So ist bei den Verkaufsangeboten im World Wide Web bisher der Kauf per Kreditkarte am weitesten verbreitet, weil er am einfachsten funktioniert. Die Vorteile: Es existiert eine etablierte Infrastruktur der Kartenunternehmen, die Abwicklung ist wahrungsunabhangig und das Zusammenspiel mit den Banken lauft bereits. In Zukunft werden On-line-Handler vermutlich einfach mehrere Zahlungsmittel akzeptieren, und E-cash wird eines davon sein.
 
Brieftaschen-Software fur mehr Sicherheit
 
Doch bis die Konsumentinnen und Konsumenten massenhaft ihre Kreditkarten zucken, muss die Technologie noch benutzerfreundlicher werden. Noch mussen Kunden ihre Kartennummer bei jedem Handler gesondert eingeben. Deswegen haben Visa und Mastercard mit Secure Electronic Transaction (SET) einen gemeinsamen Sicherheitsstandard entwickelt. Wenn sich der SET-Standard durchsetzt, werden die meisten On-line-Shopper ein sogenanntes <wallet> in ihrem PC haben eine Brieftaschen-Software, in der Kreditkartennummern und Kundenadressen abgespeichert sind.
Noch vor Benutzerfreundlichkeit ist jedoch Sicherheit Thema Nummer eins. Denn Hacker konnen im Internet Daten leicht abfangen.

02Apr97 BRAZIL:  INVESTIGATION INTO MONEY-LAUNDERING TO BE LAUNCHED.
Source: `ABC Color', Asuncion, in Spanish 31 Mar 97
Excerpts from report by Paraguayan newspaper `ABC Color' on 31st March
At last, the Money or Assets-Laundering Prevention Secretariat [Spanish: Secretaria de Prevencion de Lavado de Dinero o Bienes], presided over by Industry and Commerce Minister Ubaldo Scavone, has decided to assume investigation into alleged acts of whitewashing denounced by Brazilian legislators. The operations in question involve Brazilian and Paraguayan financial bodies. In an official communique, the institution created by law to sanction money-laundering reported that all the details of the inquiry will be maintained under bank secrecy until cases with the evidence supporting them are referred to the court.
The information obtained by the secretariat will be investigated as from this week. Technicians will track down accounts with unusual operations and will report to the Attorney-General's Office in case they find indications of possible cases of money-laundering.
The entire investigation will be conducted under a veil of silence imposed by the bank secrecy law. The Attorney-General's Office can release the name of the institutions and persons affected by the investigation only if there is hard evidence that money-laundering has taken place.
According to the law that defines the crime, an operation can be classified as money-laundering only when it is possible to prove that the origin of the funds is illegal or the money comes from a criminal organization. The evidence that funds were introduced into the economy in general or the financial system in particular without the authorities knowing the origin of those funds, is insufficient.
The inquiry became necessary after a report on foreign exchange operations submitted by Victor Chamorro, former banks superintendent and current National Development Bank (BNF) president, was made public. The report says that financial bodies in Pedro Juan Caballero and Ciudad del Este mediate in the transfer of 20m dollars a day...
The Brazilian Central Bank will shortly ask for information on current accounts opened in banks that operate in the Paraguayan market and where part of the funds obtained following a colossal fiscal swindle in that country have been deposited.

02Apr97 TAIWAN:  GOVT PLANS TO START 'WAR ON MONEY LAUNDERING' ON APRIL 23.
Taipei (CENS)-The government will officially start a war against money laundering on April 23 by requiring all financial institutions to confirm large financial transactions (exceeding NT$1.5 million in the same day), keep trading records and file reports to relevant government agencies.
In order to help fight international money laundering, the ministries of Finance and Justice have designated Hongkong, the Caymen and Bahama islands in the Caribbean as well as nations in Indochina and Central and South America as "high risk areas."
Financial institutions are obliged to report on those financial accounts that have more frequent transactions. Executives of banks that fail to do so will be fined or even prosecuted.
In addition to the mandatory reports of large transactions, the banks must contact the Bureau of Investigation about unusual and "suspected money laundering operations."
Such operations include the sudden showing of large deposits that do not match the identity and income of the persons when the money comes from sources unrelated to the persons' own business operations, the abrupt emerging of large deposits in passive accounts, the unusually quick transfers of money, or the frequent changes of small bills into large-denomination bills or vice versa.

	   Cocaine shipment seized in U.S.-Colombian drug op.......

RTna 4/2/97 6:57 PM   

    BOGOTA (Reuter) - The U.S. Coast Guard and the Colombian navy seized 1,440 pounds of cocaine in a joint operation in waters close to the Caribbean islands of San Andres and Providencia Wednesday, officials said.
     A U.S. patrol vessel initially gave chase to a high-powered speedboat suspected of transporting drugs and alerted the Colombian authorities when the craft headed into territorial waters around the two islands under Colombian jurisdiction.
     Part of the illegal narcotics shipment was dumped into the sea and the rest was found aboard the boat which was abandoned on an isolated beach in Providencia. No arrests were made, according to a statement by the Colombian navy.
     Colombia and the United States signed a maritime interdiction accord in February granting formal powers to the U.S. Coast Guard to board Colombian vessels suspected of drug trafficking outside the country's 12-mile territorial limit.

*     This Advanced Study Institute (ASI) will focus on integrating recent    *
*  advances in computational modeling and analysis with more traditional      *
*  perspectives on hearing, with the intent of fostering a more computational *
*  approach towards studies of auditory function, physiology and anatomy, as  *
*  well as defining emerging fields of inquiry derived from these innovative  *
*  methods.                                                                   *

*     Although our sense of hearing has long been the subject of intensive    *
*  scientific inquiry, computational methods have only recently been          *
*  applied to this intellectual domain with the degree of sophistication      *
*  and systematic development required for achieving significant gains in     *
*  scientific understanding. The complexity of the physiological and          *
*  anatomical substrates of auditory function, in concert with the highly     *
*  mathematical nature of hearing's physical bases, provide an ideal          *
*  scientific application for the newly emergent techniques pertaining to     *
*  scientific visualization and auralization.                                 *
*                                                                             *
*     Further progress in hearing science requires the sort of computational  *
*  techniques now being developed at various sites around the world for       *
*  modeling and visualization of complex auditory phenomena. The design of    *
*  future-generation hearing prostheses, speech recognition systems and       *
*  audio technologies all vitally depend on such methodology and the          *
*  understanding resulting from its intelligent application.                  *
*                                                                             *
*     The ASI will survey the traditional domains of hearing research,        *
*  including anatomy, physiology, psychoacoustics, speech and music, but      *
*  from a largely computational perspective. Several topics, such as          *
*  auditory scene analysis, speech recognition and auditory processing        *
*  under adverse acoustic conditions are inherently computational in          *
*  nature. Other subjects, such as the physiology of the auditory             *
*  periphery, have witnessed a significant amount of computational effort     *
*  over the past decade and a half. The goal is to provide a coherent and     *
*  comprehensive perspective on hearing that is integrated with state-of-     *
*  the-art computational modeling and visualization techniques that can       *
*  serve as the basis for a new generation of auditory research.              *

Associate Editors

The goal of building systems that can adapt to their environments and learn
from their experience has attracted researchers from many fields, including
computer science, engineering, mathematics, physics, neuroscience, and
cognitive science. Out of this research has come a wide variety of learning
techniques, including methods for learning decision trees, decision rules,
neural networks, statistical classifiers, and probabilistic graphical
models. These learning methods have the potential to transform many
industrial and scientific fields.  Many successful and profitable
applications have already been developed.

The researchers in these various areas have also produced several different
theoretical frameworks for understanding these methods, such as
computational learning theory, Bayesian learning theory, classical
statistical theory,
minimum description length theory, and statistical mechanics approaches.
These theories provide insight into experimental results and help to guide
the development of improved learning algorithms.

Recently, the many separate research communities have begun to converge on
a common set of issues surrounding supervised, unsupervised, and
reinforcement learning problems. A goal of the series is to promote the
unification of the many diverse strands of machine learning research and to
foster high quality research and innovative applications.

This book series will publish works of the highest quality that advance the
understanding and practical application of machine learning and adaptive
computation. Books appropriate for the series include:
*   Research monographs on any of the topics listed above
*   Textbooks at the introductory or advanced level
*   How-to books aimed at practitioners
*   Books intended to introduce the main goals and challenges of this
    area to a general technical audience.

           PATTERN ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS journal

                   http://www.soc.plym.ac.uk/soc/sameer/paa.htm

                                 Springer-Verlag Limited

Springer Verlag Ltd is launching a new journal - Pattern Analysis and
Applications (PAA) - in Spring 1998. Original Papers are now invited
for the journal covering the following areas of interest:

     Aims and Scope of PAA:

     The journal publishes high quality articles in areas
     of fundamental research in pattern analysis and applications. It
     aims to provide a forum for original research which describes
     novel pattern analysis techniques and industrial applications of
     the current technology. The main aim of the journal is to publish
     high quality research in intelligent pattern analysis in computer
     science and engineering. In addition, the journal will also
     publish articles on pattern analysis applications in medical
     imaging. The journal solicits articles that detail new technology

     domains including, but not limited to, computer vision and image
     processing, speech analysis, robotics, multimedia, document
     analysis, character recognition, knowledge engineering for
     pattern recognition, fractal analysis, and intelligent control.
     The journal publishes articles on the use of advanced pattern
     recognition and analysis methods including statistical
     techniques, neural networks, genetic algorithms, fuzzy pattern
     recognition, machine learning, and hardware implementations which
     are either relevant to the development of pattern analysis as a
     research area or detail novel pattern analysis applications.
     Papers proposing new classifier systems or their development,
     pattern analysis systems for real-time applications, fuzzy and
     temporal pattern recognition and uncertainty management in
     applied pattern recognition are particularly solicited.

     The journal encourages the submission of original case-studies on
     applied pattern recognition which describe important research in
     the area. The journal also solicits reviews on novel pattern
     analysis benchmarks, evaluation of pattern analysis tools, and

Biomolecular Function and Evolution in the Context of the Genome Project
========================================================================

The Organisers of the Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical
Sciences programme on "Biomolecular Function and Evolution in the
Context of the Genome Project" (July -- December 1998) invite applications 
from mathematicians and statisticians who would like to participate in the
programme.

Information about the programme is available via the WWW, at
http://www.newton.cam.ac.uk/programs/bfg.html and 'downstream' pages.

In particular, please note that a workshop entitled "Introducing
Mathematicians/Statisticians to Current Problems in Biomolecular
Sequence Analysis" is planned for the week commencing Monday 9 November
1998.  The organisers' intention is that this workshop will consist of
talks by molecular biologists attending the programme, describing research 
in the biological sciences and highlighting areas in which mathematical 
or statistical expertise is needed. Ample time will be allocated during 
the week for informal discussion and collaboration on the topics raised.

Speakers at the workshop will be drawn from the participants in the
Newton Institute programme and from molecular biology institutions in 
the Cambridge area.  It is expected that the speakers will include:

 * David Balding (Applied Statistics, Reading)
 * Peter Donnelly (Statistics, Oxford)
 * Richard Durbin (Informatics, Sanger Centre, Hinxton, Cambridge)
 * Walter Fitch (Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, UC Irvine)
 * Nick Goldman (Genetics, Cambridge)
 * Richard Goldstein (Chemistry, Michigan)
 * Jotun Hein (Biological Sciences, Aarhus)
 * Grainne McGuire (BioSS, Edinburgh)
 * Willie Taylor (Mathematical Biology, MRC-National Institute for
                  Medical Research, London)
 * Jeff Thorne (Statistical Genetics, NCSU Raleigh)

The following week of the programme (commencing Monday 16 November)
will also be available for a number of the mathematicians and 
statisticians attending the previous week's workshop to remain at the 
Newton Institute for extended discussions and collaboration. In addition,
there is the possibility that some of those interested in attending these 
two weeks will be able to participate in the programme as long-term visitors.

If you are interested in attending the one-week workshop starting on 
9 November 1998; in prolonging that visit to two weeks to participate in
the following week's discussions/collaborations; or in joining the
programme for a more extended period, please contact Nick Goldman
(N.Goldman@gen.cam.ac.uk), Dept of Genetics, Downing Street, Cambridge
CB2 3EH, or any of the Organisers for further information.  Priority
may be given to applicants who are able to join the programme
for longer periods.

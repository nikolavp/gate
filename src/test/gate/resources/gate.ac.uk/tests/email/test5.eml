Salut !
Ai citit ce se va intampla cu kinector ? Martin nu mai merge cu demo-ul la
sf. acestei saptamani. Vrea sa o accelerez puternic ca sa punem site-ul pe
Web. Am gasit deja un provider destul de bun (40$ / luna). Astept cateva
detalii si s-ar putea sa-l cumparam zilele astea (pacat ca nu avem ce pune
:) !).
Am auzit ca stai intr-un camin. Esti departe de univ ?
Cum te descurci cu engleza ?

There seem to be lots of sites that do what shafor does but cheaper (or 
more expensive)...

Iss it better to have one in Europe or in the US?
There are a couple in the UK which I have commented below (both in 
actionjackson top 10) - if we needed phone support then Cristi could do it 
more cheaply....the time difference is also less and if I go back to the 
UK maybe it is easier?.

for example http://www.asphosting.co.uk/start/newplans.asp plan C or
http://services.inetc.net/Packages/comparison.htm Gold plan

Slightly different Question:
at http://services.inetc.net/Packages/comparison.htm if I bought the 
Diamond plan (USD1000/year) I could host as many domain names ads I wanted 
- I could have as many databases as I wanted etc etc - is this right? As 
long as the space was less then 100MB.  Interestingly, if I kinector also 
re-sold space to four companies then we would get a 15% discount 
(presumably these could be autoprima, etc).

How many timeshares can you get in a 10MB database (roughly)?
I assume the webspace limit, say, at 20MB or 100MB is fine for the content 
of the kinector site (<1MB) but is the database size included in this?  On 
http://services.inetc.net/Technology/SQLServer/Default.htm it says that 
they would charge extra for Microsoft SQL Server GBP10 per 10MB(??)
In all of these it does not mention amount of traffic - in 
http://www.activewebs.net/Services/Shared/Default.htm which I believe is 
connected to http://services.inetc.net they have a special place for 
advanced NT hosting where 200MB disk space and 6GB traffic is the basic 
level - perhaps traffic is only a problem if you have a big site?
What do you think?

Until now I didn't found a good offer in UK. But, theoretically speaking, UK
would be preffered because of your previous reasons.


> for example http://www.asphosting.co.uk/start/newplans.asp plan C or

The offer at the address above seems too expensive for what they have. Plan
C means an MS Access database. Because we need a serious database server,
we'll need to buy at least plan E with a 140 GBP / month. Too much !!!


> http://services.inetc.net/Packages/comparison.htm Gold plan

They offer Access database, but they can upgrade to SQL Server :
"we can upgrade your account to include SQL Server - the charge is GBP1.00pm
per Mb, minimum 10Mb."
Seems that we'll need to pay at least 10 BGP / month (for 10 MB) only for
the database + 30 GBP / month (the gold plan). Too much !

About unlimited databases. They say unlimited DSN. A DSN is like a link to a
database (Data Source Name). So they offer unlimited database links. But I
think that you pay separately the database itself (1 GBP / month / MB).


> How many timeshares can you get in a 10MB database (roughly)?

A table with 81.000 records (2 fields : first name, last name) is around 3
MB.
But there are other additional files (for logs, transactions) that migh
exced the space.
That's why I've asked the ones at Shafor how much is the extra SQL Server
space.


> I assume the webspace limit, say, at 20MB or 100MB is fine for the content

Yes, they charge 1 GBP / month / MB. It seems that the database space is
payed separately (it's high-priced than the site's space), but I do not know
for sure.


> In all of these it does not mention amount of traffic - in

The extra trafic is payed separately.
I found an offer with 6 GB / month (http://www.iland.com/pricing.htm) with
80$ / month (database included) for 100 MB space (seems that the database is
included in this). $60 / GB extra bandwidth.
2 GB for the begining (for testing) seems good for us (I read somewhere that
1 milion hits ~ 1 GB : of course depends a lot of the site content). And if
we exced it, we'll pay maybe 100$ and we'll decide to upgrade the package
(or move somewhere else).

Could I take this opportunity to remind everyone that the University has a 
no smoking policy.
Smoking is prohibited in this building as it is in all university buildings.

If you let me know which machine you are logging in to, I will try to sort this 
out for you. Basically, you can change your shell if you are logging in to 
hazel, but not by default on a "non-server" without Support action.

Let me know your details, please, and I will get it sorted out.

Dear All,

The upgrade is dependent of resolving several outstanding issues so
it be defered.

Please let me know if this is a problem for you. (by emailing support).

Thanks

Da.....Bine ca mi-ai spus sa nu-mi mai fac sperante de pomana!
Nu aveam de unde sa stiu ca Rominia nu este in EU.Trebuie sa apara bursele
Socrates, asa ca sper sa fie o bursa si acolo....(cum Cristea are legaturi,
sunt ceva sanse). Mai vedem!
I-am dat telefon mamei si mi-a spus ca a citit mesajele noastre(chiar mi-a
trimis mie mesajul dspre care ti-am spus), dar acum cind a vrut sa trimta
mesaje, primeste o eroare(dupa ce este verificata parola), ceva de genul
"protocol configuration .......connection property ".....Adi spune ca este
curios, ca totusi au reusit sa trimita un mesaj;si mama mi-a spus ca nu a
facut alte modificari pe acolo(doar a scris mesajele si voia sa le trimita).
DE aceea nu ne-a raspuns la mesaje. Tu ai vreo idee?

Can you confirm with crystaltech that site+database can be upto 300MB - in 
your previous email from shafor they mentioned a "standard" database - we 
just want to make sure that the crystaltech database is big enough...

You said that a table 81000x2 (I assume that 2 tables of 40000 is roughly 
equal to the same) was around 3MB - there are 5000 resorts in the world 
each with, say, 50 apartments each with 52 weeks.  Even 1% of this is 130 
000 not counting requests.  Also if we extend to vacation rentals genarlly 
then the numbers might increase dramatically.
Even if we only end up referring 1-2% of the market then this means at 
least 1000 resorts with, say, 40 potential fields in each and up to 100000 
apartments with say 40 fields in each.

I assume if we do not use the full allocation of memeory we can use for 
xprimo board anyway (this also potentially massive database).

Do you want me to buy it today?  If it is $100 now and then $50 bucks a 
month this is fine if this is what you want - does it have the XML stuff 
you wanted?  We do not need to buy any software (SQL server etc) do we - 
all of it is hosted by them?

They have a domain registration for $35 - I also want to register 
xprimo.com and xprimo.net (I like this for the board name) but we also 
need to choose a name for the B2B kinector - (I have already registered 
kinector.com/net).

I reckon something simple like WEEKBASE.NET/COM is best (week-database) - 
what do you think?  I hope it doesn't sound too much like weakbase (as in 
not strong).   The problem with week is that it sounds like weak - so 
weeklink would be a nice name except that there is an expression that if 
someone is the weak link then they will casue a disaster. WEEX.NET
XWEEX.COM/NET is available

Ok I have the answer - SEEKWEEKS.COM /NET OR SEEKWEEK.COM /NET

It's up to you - let me know and I will get the names at the same time as 
I get the domain hositng that you tell me to get.

Cristi - hope your first couple of days went well....

Martin

Cristi, eu cind am sunat-o, ea era la pregatire, si am inteles ca va fi
acasa  in jurul orei 8. Problema este ca a putut sa  trimita si sa citeasca
posta azi,  dar acum nu se mai poate conecta(nu am intrebat-o, dar daca se
blocheaza dupa ce este verificata parola, inseamna ca NU poate sa cieasca
posta,nu?)
Cum de umblat nu a umblat prin setari, este posibil sa fie cazut serverul
iiruc-ului?(imi dau si eu cu parerea).
Oricum, tu trimite mesajul cu ce presupui tu ca ar fi, iar eu ii voi mai da
telefon mai diseara s-o intreb daca poate sa citeaasca posta si sa-i spun
eventual ce ar putea sa incerce.
O sa-ti mai scriu in seara asta (dupa ce discut cu mama) un mesaj, iar miine
cind vei veni , il vei citi!

Mama mi-a spus la telefon ca a citit mesajele trimise si de mine si de tine.
Ea ne-a compus un raspuns, iar cind sa ni le trimita, ii dadea eroare. Nu
stiu daca ii da eroare inainte sau dupa ce da ea F7.
Urmeaza sa-i dau un telefon(dar dupa 9 ) in seara asta, sa aflu mai multe
amanunte (voi afla si textul corect al erorii)  si o sa-i spun sa faca si ce
mi-ai zis tu. Alte noutati le vei mai primi miine pe tema asta(tu nu mai
stai pina atunci) ...Pe miine!
Te pupam,A&A

Martin, I'll make some more tests to see how much space do we need. I'm
afraid that we migh need a dedicated server (not necessarily now, at the
begining). But give me a couple of hours (3-4) to finish the tests ...

Disable DNS sunt doar niste spatii goale cu niste puncte intre ele. Este
tare ciudat pentru ca eu am primit un mesaj azi de acasa, iar mama a reusit
sa citeasca posta trimisa de noi. Ea spune ca nu a umblat pe acolo, deci
intr-un fel s-au dezactivat(cum??) Mesajul de eroare pe care il
primeste(dupa ce apasa F7) este ceva de genul: "Protocol not configure.
Please check you Dial-up Network. Unable to estabilish connection...Please
make sure that your connection are configurated propriety! "
Eu nu stiu acele numere, i-am sfatuit sa vorbeasca cu cineva de la iiruc si
sa vina sa le scrie ei. Oricum, ele au fost azi, din moment ce mama a putut
sa trimita si sa citeasca posta, dar cum au disparut?!!? Cam asta este, ei
spera ca miine sa rezolve si problema asta.
Cam asta este:
Hai sa-ti spun pe scurt  ce s-a intimplat la Nikita.
Madeline si-a pus in cap sa-i desparta pe ei (Michael si N) cu orice pret.
I-a spus Nihkitei sa se desparta de  M pentru ca au incalcat nu stiu ce
directiva( la inceput a aratat o misiune in care Michael a schimbat
planurile in timp ce se desfasura misiunea, ca sa se duca si sa o protejeze
pe Nichita...)
Bineinteles ca Nichita nu a fost de acord, asa ca comandantul si Madeline au
trecut la masuri represive: l-au retrogradat pe Michael, l-au dat afara din
birou , asa incit el ajunsese ultimul om din echipa. Nu mai avea nici PAD de
ala, el trebuia sa se ocupe sa le stearga bocancii la astia(exagerez eu....)
Tipul care il inlocuia pe M (care conducea acuma misiunile) nu era asa de
bun ca el si ei pierdeau oameni in misiuni. M era din ce in ce mai nervos,
asa incit Nichita este de acord sa renunte la M. Acesta accepta  si se duce
la comandat si-i spune ca au hotarit sa nu se mai intilneasca (camerele lor
erau supravegheate) . Se termina asa: M se duce la Nikita si din pragul usii
ii spune :"am venit sa-ti spun ceva important ....sa stii ca nu s-a
terminat".
Este fain, nu?Cum va reusi sa ii pacaleasca pe astia, in episodul
urmator..........

100 resorts + 3.000 timeshares ... 5MB
200 resorts + 6.000 timeshares ... 8 MB

Each resort has 4 amenities and a small comment of 20 characters.
Each unit posted has 4 facilities declared.

I'll let the computer to generate more timeshares (hope to have 3.000 in the
morning - works pretty slow, maybe my SQL Server has something....).

About the names : I like "weex.net" (or "weex.com"). Why can't we use the
"kinector" ? Do you want to make the kinector the repository for the tools
(tools for timeshares and later for cars etc.) ?

About the provider : http://www.crystaltech.com/hostingplans.htm seems the
best. Let's buy it (plan III - $50 / month). If later we'll need more space
and speed we'll upgrade to a dedicated server
(http://www.crystaltech.com/dedicatedservers.htm - PIII at 550MHz with 256
MB RAM + 8 GB bandwidht for 400 $/month).

I thought in terms of product names:

kinector - for the referral clearing house and associate system - we can 
then use it for real estate etc - if we do a timeshare site then we do not 
necessarily have to give the technology away
xprimo (?) - bulletin board

seekweeks for the timeshare kinector (or we could use timekinector.com / 
housekinector / carkinector but I think these are a bit long)

weex.com is a oil/gas exchange company so I thought weex.net might be 
confusing...

I will buy the domain site this morning - if I have questions on the 
application forms I will emial - can you respond quickly...

Martin

100 resorts + 3.000 timeshares ... 5MB
200 resorts + 6.000 timeshares ... 8 MB

Each resort has 4 amenities and a small comment of 20 characters.
Each unit posted has 4 facilities declared.

I'll let the computer to generate more timeshares (hope to have 3.000 in 
the
morning - works pretty slow, maybe my SQL Server has something....).

About the names : I like "weex.net" (or "weex.com"). Why can't we use the
"kinector" ? Do you want to make the kinector the repository for the tools
(tools for timeshares and later for cars etc.) ?

About the provider : http://www.crystaltech.com/hostingplans.htm seems the
best. Let's buy it (plan III - $50 / month). If later we'll need more 
space
and speed we'll upgrade to a dedicated server
(http://www.crystaltech.com/dedicatedservers.htm - PIII at 550MHz with 256
MB RAM + 8 GB bandwidht for 400 $/month).

I have paid for the site - I went for Plan III for the 3 months for the 
price of 2 option so we cannot cancel.
I have also got them to register seekweek.com as the domain for the moment 
(for half price).
I will call adi by phone to give the username and password for entry - I 
do not know if we can have more than one person accessed at any one time - 
we can check this later.
They will email me during the next 24 hours to tell us how to access and 
set it all up.

We're about to get on the www!!

Martin

Subject: millennial science essay competition 1996
Date: Thu, 18 Apr 96 12:20:13 BST

We have received a notice from the Wellcome Centre for Medical Science
regarding the above.

This competition is open to all postgraduates in science, engineering 
or technology who are writing up their doctoral thesis.  There will
be a cash prize of £1000 and a second prize of £500 and two
third prizes of £250.  All winners and the 10 best essays will receive
a year's subscription to the NEW SCIENTIST.

The challenge is to write an entertaining essay in English about your
research in no more than 800 words, suitable for publication in the 
Forum section of NEW SCIENTIST.

The entries will be assessed by a panel of judges selected by the Wellcome 
Centre for Medical Science and NEW SCIENTIST.  The judges will be looking 
for interesting research topics, scientific accuracy, clarity of expression 
and a lively writing style.  The names of the winners will be published in 
the 19 October issue of NEW SCIENTIST.

An entry form for the competition and further details can be obtained from 
Dr Paul Wymer, The Wellcome Centre for Medical Science, 210 Euston Road, 
LONDON, NW1 2BE, to whom you should subsequently send your entry.  THE 
COMPETITION CLOSES FOR ENTRIES ON 17 JUNE 1996.  The organisers cannot 
undertake to return manuscripts, illustrative matter or floppy discs.

COMPETITION RULES:

1	Entrants must be currently registered for a PhD at an internationally 
	recognised university.  There are no age limits.

2	Entries must be typed, or legibly written, in English, using only 
	one side of the paper.  Give your full name and home address on the 
	entry form and your surname in the top right-hand corner of all 
	subsequent pages.

3	Entries of more than 800 words in length (not including description 
	of any graphic illustration or photographs) will be disqualified.

4	The judges' decision is final and no correspondence will be entered 
	on the nature of assessment or the final results.

*     This Advanced Study Institute (ASI) will focus on integrating recent    *
*  advances in computational modeling and analysis with more traditional      *
*  perspectives on hearing, with the intent of fostering a more computational *
*  approach towards studies of auditory function, physiology and anatomy, as  *
*  well as defining emerging fields of inquiry derived from these innovative  *
*  methods.                                                                   *

*     Although our sense of hearing has long been the subject of intensive    *
*  scientific inquiry, computational methods have only recently been          *
*  applied to this intellectual domain with the degree of sophistication      *
*  and systematic development required for achieving significant gains in     *
*  scientific understanding. The complexity of the physiological and          *
*  anatomical substrates of auditory function, in concert with the highly     *
*  mathematical nature of hearing's physical bases, provide an ideal          *
*  scientific application for the newly emergent techniques pertaining to     *
*  scientific visualization and auralization.                                 *
*                                                                             *
*     Further progress in hearing science requires the sort of computational  *
*  techniques now being developed at various sites around the world for       *
*  modeling and visualization of complex auditory phenomena. The design of    *
*  future-generation hearing prostheses, speech recognition systems and       *
*  audio technologies all vitally depend on such methodology and the          *
*  understanding resulting from its intelligent application.                  *
*                                                                             *
*     The ASI will survey the traditional domains of hearing research,        *
*  including anatomy, physiology, psychoacoustics, speech and music, but      *
*  from a largely computational perspective. Several topics, such as          *
*  auditory scene analysis, speech recognition and auditory processing        *
*  under adverse acoustic conditions are inherently computational in          *
*  nature. Other subjects, such as the physiology of the auditory             *
*  periphery, have witnessed a significant amount of computational effort     *
*  over the past decade and a half. The goal is to provide a coherent and     *
*  comprehensive perspective on hearing that is integrated with state-of-     *
*  the-art computational modeling and visualization techniques that can       *
*  serve as the basis for a new generation of auditory research.              *

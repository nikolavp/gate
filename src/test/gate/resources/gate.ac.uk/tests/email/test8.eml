Dear Vavo Member

If you're sitting at home afraid to go out in case you run out of fuel,
visit Vavo and find out just where there is petrol available

We have managed to get hold of the full list of fuel stations that have
received deliveries today, right across the UK!!

It has been confirmed as accurate by several sources and so we've decided to
make it available to you as part of our commitment to adding value to our
members

You simply need to follow this link
http://www.vavo.com/travel/petrolavail.asp and download the list, I then
recommend that you get the number of your nearest garages and ring and
confirm that fuel is still available

You may wish to forward this to friends and family in order to bring them
'up to speed'

Happy Motoring!

RGS

lucy

please order this asap; christian and gill have details if you need them

can we (me, you, gill) meet next week to talk about how orders are
managed? my main concern is that I never know what status an order is
at after asking for it; perhaps we can organise some sort of tracking
arrangement

thanks

Dear cristian

My trivia games are now connected to the big prize diallers. This means
more CASH....lots more CASH!

I'm now giving away a massive £700 per session in my funky 70's
multiplayer trivia quiz game - getminted fever.
http://www.getminted.com/dpages/fever/index.html The game lasts under
three minutes and if you finish in the top 50 you are guaranteed a minimum
prize of £5. The current session has only just begun and the top prize is
£100 so come along and getminted.

I'm also giving away a £20 jackpot per game if you answer ten questions
correctly in my 50's trivia game - getminted original.
http://www.getminted.com/dpages/original/index.html

There really is no easier way to getminted - so come and join me and the
other contestants in the trivia games rooms now!

Oh and by the way, thanks for testing my special local rate diallers.
They're long gone now baby so you will need to visit my site to download
the new ones to play for big cash.

Goodluck and getminted!

Bob Cash
http://www.getminted.com

PS. Remember you can also win £1,000,000 by registering six numbers in the
getminted quick free lottery draw.

The Role of the Web in Voice eCommerce Portals
by David Strom

In one of my favorite Star Trek scenes, Scotty is transported back to 
present day Earth and sits down in front of Mac to design a tank to hold 
a whale. He picks up the mouse and starts talking to it as he would the 
computers on board the Enterprise. "Computer? Computer?" After no 
response, he says, "I'll just use the keyboard" and furiously starts 
typing away.

Herein lies a lesson for those of you designing voice portals for 
eCommerce. Make your voice-activated interfaces simple. Otherwise, your 
customers will either turn to other, more familiar input methods or 
leave your site altogether. So, if you are contemplating using one of 
these voice portals, learn from some others' mistakes.

I know many people who love the phone answering service Wildfire; but, 
every attempt left me so frustrated and tangled deep inside its menu 
tree, I was tempted to say "Wildfire, get lost!" (or stronger words I'd 
rather not use here). When designing your prompts, provide quick 
mobility through the system for experienced users while still 
maintaining a mutually exclusive, and collectively exhaustive, list of 
obvious choices. A very hard bill to fill. I seem to be one of those 
people that gets to the end of a long list of voice menu prompts and has 
to hold on for a human to deal with my question.

Another important design point:   Make the system more navigable via 
voice commands than a quick typist surfing your Web site. FedEx's 
packing scheduling system is a perfect example. Their site provides a 
great application. Using nothing more than your browser, you can print 
out airbills from your PC printer. Naturally, this service requires an 
established FedEx account and you a special password for the Web site; 
but, once you're setup, it takes less time to type in your information 
than to handwrite it on a paper airbill. Plus, you don't have to worry 
about keeping the paper supplies on hand.

The trouble begins with a second FedEx application designed to schedule 
package pickups. Yesterday, I was finally able to utilize this Web 
feature, rather than using the toll-free number. On several previous 
attempts earlier this year, I encountered nothing but database errors 
whenever I tried to schedule pickups using the Web application. Still, 
when the application works it takes less time than using the phone, and 
that's what really counts. On the phone, I have to key in my account 
number and zip code -- the web application already has that information. 
That is a smart, time saving design.

Not all voice applications are as speedy, however. Michelle Rafter 
looked at five sites for an Industry Standard article in this week and 
found that all of them were slower using their voice prompts than doing 
equivalent tasks on Yahoo's web site.  ("Navigating the voice prompts 
was like playing 20 questions," is one example of her comments.)
http://www.thestandard.com/article/display/0,1151,18158,00.html

Remember, we are still at the very beginning of the voice portal 
industry, but in the meantime proceed with caution and speak forcefully 
and clearly.

On Thursday and Friday of Intro Week (21 & 22 September) CiCS will be
running their usual demonstrations outlining the use of University IT
facilities for new students. The demos last approximately 30 minutes
and start on the following hours both days 11:00, 12:00, 13:00, 14:00,
15:00. They will take place in the Auditorium (Cinema) in the Union of
Students' building. 

If you have any interaction with new students during this week, 
please encourage then to attend any one of these sessions.

A flyer has been placed in the CiCS Starter Pack, which is received by
all new students when registrating. The main contents of this year's
Starter Pack are reproduced on the CiCS Web pages:
http://www.shef.ac.uk/cics/docs/starterpack/

The Managed NT Service is now the main service for students and CiCS 
also want to help returning students who may not have used it last 
year. Hence, brief demonstrations will be provided to inform 
returning undergraduate students. The first of these demonstration 
will take place in the Auditorium (Cinema) in the Union of Students' 
building on Wednesday 20 September, (10:00am, noon, and 2:00pm) with 
additional dates being planned for early in the new semester. 
Documents will also be provided on the counters of IT Centres to help 
returning students make the easy transition to the new service. 

Thank you

Greetings Capricorn,

Here is your horoscope for Thursday, September 14:

Savor what you love, even if it's not the refreshing challenge that 
it used to be. There's room for both art and science in today's approach. 
You'll do or say anything in pursuit of your desire.

For Cancer,

Some unconscious or hidden movement turns on the lights or opens 
the drapes. You've unknowingly fallen in step with some universal 
program. Learn all about what you're doing so that you can repeat 
it at will.

For Leo,

You know what you need. If you're lucky, others will recognize the 
situation before you have to beg. A veneer of formality helps everyone 
save face in potentially embarrassing times.

For Virgo,

Something is late for its appointment with destiny. Delay works to 
your benefit if you can tilt the odds in your favor. Clarify the 
unspoken rather than just assuming it.

For Libra,

You may be asked some difficult questions. You're so locked into 
process that you may be losing the overall direction. Like it or 
not, it's time for a review.

For Scorpio,

When they ask you, answer them cheerfully and thoroughly. This adventure 
kicks into gear as soon as everyone is vibrating at the same harmonic 
frequency. Match each shooting spark with a jewel of your own.


Until tomorrow,

Kelli Fox, Your iVillage Astrologer

Dear Colleague,

Printing Resources produced an A3 desk pad which was handed 
out at the University Supplier's Exhibition held in the Octagon 
Centre.  If any member of staff would like a pad these are still 
available from Printing Resources, free of charge.

The pad has been printed this year on behalf of Corporate Services 
and gives contact details of all the sections.  The pad also displays 
an academic year calendar with semester dates.

If you would like to request a pad, please email myself and we will

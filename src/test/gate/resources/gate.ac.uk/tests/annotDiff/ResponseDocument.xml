<author>By Paul Cullen</author>
It may not prove the end of the <pos cat="BORG">world</pos> as we <pos cat="V">know</pos> it, but it could be a close-run <pos cat="N">thing</pos>.
For the first <pos cat="N">time</pos>, <bom cat="N">scientists</bom> are formally predicting that the <pos cat="N">Earth</pos> could <pos cat="V">be</pos> hit by an <pos cat="N">asteroid</pos>,
scheduled <pos cat="V">to arrive</pos> 30 <pos cat="N">years</pos> <pos cat="PREP">from</pos> now.
September 21st, 2030, is the date pencilled in for the arrival of 2000 SG344,
a lump of space debris the size of an office block that could strike our planet with the force of
 100 Hiroshima <pos cat="N">atom</pos>    <pos cat="N">bombs</pos>.

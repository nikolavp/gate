<p>One. The Minister for Foreign Affairs asked me to call this afternoon
and handed me in strict confidence a Japanese text accompanied by a
strictly confidential unofficial English translation hereof embodying a
message in reply sent by his Imperial 
Majesty's Foreign Minister at the request of the Prime Minister for
delivery to the President of the United States of America, dated July 7,
Showa 16. (See Embassy's 951, July 8, 5 p.m.)</p> 

<p>Two. At the same time the Minister handed to me in strict confidence
a Japanese text accompanied by a strictly confidential unofficial
English translation of the oral statement handed by the Minister for
Foreign Affairs to the Soviet Ambassador in Tokyo on July 2, 1941. 
(See Embassy's 955, July 8, 6 p.m.)</p>


<p>Three. Having read the Minister's message I said that I was in a
position to advance pertinent comment on the final paragraph of the
Japanese message and it hereupon conveyed orally to Mr. Matsuoka the
substance of Department's telegram No. 355, June 27, 2 p.m. I
particularly emphasized the first sentence of the second paragraph of
that telegram and dwelt at some length on the policy of the United
States in that connection. The Minister replied to the effect that
reports reaching Japan have convinced the Japanese people the United
States is determined to intervene in the European conflict and that this
conviction has caused widespread anxiety in the view of Japan's
obligations to her Allies in the Tripartite Pact. </p>

<p>Four. I then asked the Minister what sort of future developments
he had in mind which would largely
determine Japan's future policy toward Soviet Russia as set forth in the
final sentence of his oral statement of July 2 to the Soviet Ambassador.
The Minister replied that he had in mind a good many possible
developments among which he might mention as illustrations: the altered
situation which would be created if Soviet Russia should form an
alliance with Great Britain or if the United States should attempt to
send considerable quantities of war supplies to Soviet Russia through
Vladivostok to be used against Germany, Japan's ally. He said that there
are powerful elements in Japan who are trying to force him into
hostilities against Soviet Russia and that if these elements and the
Japanese people should become aware of the conveyance of such American
supplies great provocation would be created which would strengthen the
hand of those extremists and would render his own position and his own
sincere efforts to preserve peace even more difficult than they are at
present.</p>

<p>Five. Mr. Matsuoka especially asked me to convey to you the fact that
neither the Soviet Ambassador in Tokyo nor the Soviet Government had
raised any question or objection in connection with the public statement
which he, Mr. Matsuoka, had issued on returning from Europe (please see
Embassy's 589, April 22, 7 p.m.). He also said that he had recently
appealed both to Stalin and Molotov to cooperate with him by endeavoring
not to render more difficult the extremely difficult path which he is
now treading.</p>

<p>Six. The Minister said that he had recently met the Soviet Ambassador
at the railway station in Berlin when the latter was saying good bye to
his wife and other ladies of the Soviet Embassy who were about to return
to Russia. He said to the Ambassador that the ladies of the Japanese
Embassy in Moscow had left that capitol in order to avoid the dangers of
possible bombing by the German Army but that no such dangers existed in
Tokyo and there was no good reason whatever for the Soviet ladies to
leave. The Minister said that the Soviet ladies had, therefore,
abandoned their plans for departure.</p>

<p>Seven. The Minister said that in these difficult times we must all of
us guard against the often baseless rumors which are floating around in
every country and when I mentioned the reports published in various
Japanese papers such as the YOMIURI the HOCHI, etc., Mr. Matsuoka
shrugged his shoulders and said that he never read newspapers of that
nature.</p>

<p>Eight. In the light of the Minister's written and oral statements I
find it very difficult to believe that the Japanese Government has
decided at this time to embark on hostilities against the Soviet
Union.</p>

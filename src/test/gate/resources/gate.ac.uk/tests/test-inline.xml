<p class="bigCrumb">Airlines take over running of air traffic control</p>



<p>FT.com site, Jul 27, 2001<br/>
BY &quot;KEVIN DONE, AEROSPACE CORRESPONDENT&quot;<br/>
</p>
<p class="allWide"></p><TEXT><p>Seven &lt;<Location>UK</Location>&gt; airlines including <Organization>British Airways</Organization>, <Organization>Virgin Atlantic</Organization>, <Organization>BMI British Midland</Organization> &amp; <Organization>EasyJet</Organization>, on <Date>Friday</Date> took over control of the air traffic control system, completing one of the government&apos;s most controversial public-private partnership deals.</p>

<p>Completion of the &quot;<Organization>National Air Traffic Services</Organization>&quot; deal comes at a critical time for the government as it tries to push through the PPP for the <Organization>London Underground</Organization>.</p>

<p>The sale to a strategic investor of a <Percent>46 per cent</Percent> stake in &quot;<Organization>Nats</Organization>&quot; is the first time in &lt;&lt;<Location>Europe</Location>&gt; that management control of en route air traffic services has passed into private hands.</p>


<p>It has been carried out despite a pledge by <Organization>Labour</Organization> before the <Date>1997</Date> general election that &lt;<Location>UK</Location>&gt; air was &quot;not for sale."</p>

<p>Under the terms of the deal, which was approved by the European competition authorities in <Date>May</Date>, the government has retained a <Percent>49 per cent</Percent> stake &amp; a golden share, while a <Percent>5 per cent</Percent> stake is to be allocated to <Organization>Nats</Organization>&apos; 5,700 staff.</p>

<p>&quot;<Organization>The Airline Group</Organization>&quot;, which also includes the charter carriers <Organization>Airtours International Airways</Organization>, <Organization>Britannia Airways</Organization> &amp; <Organization>Monarch Airlines</Organization>, is paying <Money>GBP50m</Money> (<Money>$71m</Money>) to acquire the <Percent>46 per cent</Percent> stake.</p>

<p>Total government proceeds from the deal amount to about <Money>GBP800m</Money>, with the lion&apos;s share of the funds coming from new debt raised by <Organization>Nats</Organization>. <Organization>The Airline Group</Organization> has agreed financing facilities for <Organization>Nats</Organization> with a group of banks led by <Organization>Barclays</Organization> &amp; <Organization>Abbey National</Organization>.</p>

<p>Completion of the deal has come about two months behind the original schedule announced at the <Date>end of March</Date>.</p>

<p>It is understood that negotiations were held up by concerns expressed by the banks financing the deal about revised traffic forecasts presented by &quot;<Organization>Nats</Organization>&quot; after the selection of <Organization>the Airline Group</Organization> as the government&apos;s partner was announced at the <Date>end of March</Date>.</p>





<p>&quot;<Organization>The Airline Group</Organization>&quot; is taking over <Organization>Nats</Organization> at a difficult time with air traffic control capacity under increasing pressure from rising air traffic volumes.</p>

<p>For the first time <Date>last year</Date> &quot;<Organization>Nats</Organization>&quot; handled more than 2m air traffic movements with volumes growing by <Percent>5 per cent</Percent> in <Date>2000</Date>.</p>


<p>The <Organization>London Area &amp; Terminal Control Centre</Organization> (&quot;<Organization>LATCC</Organization>&quot;), which handles aircraft over &lt;<Location>England</Location>&gt; &amp; &lt;<Location>Wales</Location>&gt; &amp; the surrounding seas, is dealing with more than 6,300 aircraft on peak days &amp; is operating close to capacity.</p>


<p>The most immediate challenge facing &quot;<Organization>Nats</Organization>&quot; is to start operations at its much delayed <Money>GBP700m</Money> centre for en route air traffic control at &lt;<Location>Swanwick</Location>&gt;, &lt;<Location>Hampshire</Location>&gt;, <Date>next January</Date>.</p>



<p>&quot;<Organization>The Airline Group</Organization>&quot; has committed itself to a <Organization>Nats</Organization> investment programme totalling more than <Money>GBP1bn</Money> during the <Date>next 10 years</Date> to upgrade the &lt;<Location>UK</Location>&gt; air traffic control system &amp; provide extra capacity.</p>


<p>The <Money>GBP700m</Money> new centre at &lt;<Location>Swanwick</Location>&gt; is more than five years behind schedule &amp; <Money>GBP200m</Money> over budget.</p></TEXT>

Building the GATE Installer
---------------------------

The GATE installer is now created by ant.  Run "bin/ant installer" from the
top-level GATE directory.

The resulting installer is a JAR with a Main-Class manifest attribute, and
should launch on double-click on most platforms.  If it doesn't launch with a
double click it will run with "java -jar".  For release builds we may consider
packaging the JAR installer up as an .exe for Windows (using launch4j) and a
.dmg for Mac OS.

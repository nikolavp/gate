<H2>Reporting bugs</H2>

<P>
If you think you have found a bug in GATE, please:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>
Make sure you are using the latest build of GATE.  Many problems are found and
fixed between major releases, and if you report a bug against a specific
release of GATE the first thing we will ask you to do is try using the latest
nightly build.
</LI>
<LI>
Make sure you are using a supported version of Java.  GATE 3.1 requires a Java
runtime version 1.4.2 or later, GATE 4.0 beta 1 requires Java 5.0, and GATE 6.1 or later
requires Java 6.0.
</LI>
<LI>
Check the <A HREF="http://gate.ac.uk/documentation.html">documentation</A>, to make sure
your environment is set up properly, and double check that you have followed
the correct procedure (e.g. if using GATE as a library, that you have called
<tt>Gate.init</tt> before using the <tt>Factory</tt>, that you have loaded the
correct plugins, etc.).
</LI>
<LI>
Check the <A HREF="http://gate.ac.uk/mail/">mailing list archive</A> and search the existing
<A HREF="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=143829&atid=756796">bug
reports</A> to see if your problem has already been reported (and possibly
fixed).
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Once you are sure you have found a bug, please let the appropriate person know
about it.  Bugs in the core of GATE or in the plugins bundled with the GATE
distribution should be reported using the
<A HREF="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=add&group_id=143829&atid=756796">SourceForge
bug tracker</A>.  Bugs in third-party plugins should generally be reported to
the plugin maintainer in the first instance, so the maintainer can
determine whether the bug is in their code or in the GATE core.
</P>

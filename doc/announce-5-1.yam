GATE Version 5.1 release (December 2009)

Version 5.1 is a major increment with lots of new features and integration of
a number of important systems from 3rd parties (e.g. LingPipe, OpenNLP,
OpenCalais, a revised UIMA connector). We've stuck with the 5 series (instead

Other highlights include:

- an entirely new %(http://gate.ac.uk/userguide/chap:ontologies, ontology API)

- new %(http://gate.ac.uk/userguide/chap:profiling, benchmarking facilities)

There is a raft of efficiency and infrastructure improvements including revamped HTML handling, Java 5 support and numerous optimisations and bug fixes. The set of plugins available has expanded to include around 150 components, which integrate with many high-quality language processing tools from the wider research community (<a href="http://gate.ac.uk/gate/doc/plugins.html">http://gate.ac.uk/gate/doc/plugins.html</a>).</p>
        <p>GATE is free and open (under the LGPL licence) and you are very welcome to use it for both commercial and research purposes. A number of businesses now use GATE in production applications, from large corporates like Thompson to startups like Garlik or Innovantage. Research, teaching and student users represent a high proportion of labs working on language and knowledge worldwide.</p>
        <p>Plans for the future include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a new version of the JAPE finite state annotation processing language</li>
            <li>more and better integration with related systems and tools</li>
            <li>SAFE, the Semantic Annotation Factory Environment: <a href="http://gate.ac.uk/safe/">http://gate.ac.uk/safe/</a></li>

        <p>GATE is developed on Ubuntu (and other less advanced operating systems).</p>

        <h2>GATE 3.0 (build 1846), January 14th 2005</h2>
        <p>This is the final release of version 3.0. This is a stable release and supercedes all previous versions.</p>
        <p>New features include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>completely rewritten document viewer/editor</li>
            <li>extensive ontology support</li>
            <li>a new plugin management system</li>
            <li>lots more CREOLE plugins, including Chemistry Tagger, Montreal 	Transducer, RASP Parser, MiniPar, Buchart Parser, MinorThird, NP 	Chunker, Stemmer, TreeTagger, Probability Finder, Crawler, Google PR, 	SVM Light, ...</li>
            <li>faster JAPE compiles, and removal of dependency on Sun Java 	compiler</li>
            <li>separate .jar files and Tomcat classloading fixes</li>
            <li>transparent XML-based application serialisation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>See <a href="http://gate.ac.uk/sale/tao">chapter 2 (Change Log)</a> of the User Guide for full details of what has changed.</p>
        <p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> for version 3 we decided that it was worthwhile making a few incompatible changes in order to clean up a couple of things that have caused trouble in previous versions. For example: some recent classes have been renamed (particularly the ontologies support classes); a few new events have been added; datastores created by version 3 will probably not read properly in version 2. If you have problems use the <a href="http://gate.ac.uk/mail/index.html">mailing list</a> and we'll help you fix your code!</p>
        <p>Version 3.1 will be a bug fix and minor adjustments to new features release; <a href="http://gate.ac.uk/mail/index.html">send us your comments</a>.</p>
        <p>GATE is free software, developed using public research funds. If you find it useful, don't keep it a secret!</p>

</FONT><B><FONT SIZE=4><P>High-level Summary</P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fundamental aim of this project is to boost productivity in natural language processing (NLP) research in the UK. At present a large amount of time is wasted by highly-skilled researchers who must continually reinvent the wheel when starting a new project or a new set of experiments. As in other fields, language processing work involves repetitive tasks that provide necessary infrastructure but do not directly advance our R&amp;D. Unfortunately, whereas in other fields advanced computational tools are available that fulfil infrastructural needs (e.g. MatLab or Mathematica for mathematicians), no such general infrastructure is available in NLP. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Every PhD thesis or research grant from EPSRC (or the EC) typically begins its software development phase by defining a new set of tools and data structures for tasks such as:</P>

<UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>the management of the textual data to be processed;</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>the storage and exchange of information about texts; </LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>the visualisation of the data (essential for efficient development and debugging);</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>the comparison of the results of different configurations of software or with human-produced results;</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>accessing resources such as lexicons and dictionaries that each has its own idiosyncratic format.</LI></P></UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All of these tasks require robust, engineered software solutions, and all of them are key factors in the success of UK NLP research. The types of data structure typically produced and manipulated by NLP programs are large and complex, and without good tools to manage storage of, and allow succinct graphical viewing of, these structures, we work below our potential. At this stage in the progress of our field, no one should really have to write a tree viewing program for the output of a syntax analyser, for example, or even have to do significant work to get an existing viewing tool to process their data. While it is true that a number of specialised infrastructures exist, these are tied into particular theoretical commitments, for example attribute-value matrices evaluated under unification. Particularly at a time when statistical and hybrid statistical/symbolic work is so prevalent, these specialised systems cannot fulfil the role of a general NLP architecture.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, many common language processing tasks have been solved to an acceptable degree by previous work and should be reused. Instead of writing a new part of speech tagger, or sentence splitter, or list of common nominal compounds, we should have available a store of reusable tools and data that can be plugged into our new systems with minimal effort. Such reuse is much less common than it should be, often because of installation and integration problems that have to be solved afresh in each case, and this is a major waste of research funding.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Building on previous work funded by the EPSRC, this project will eliminate the need for the majority of language processing workers to bother with infrastructure. We will provide the equivalent of Mathematica for language research and development. We will also make available a wide range of building blocks for common tasks (e.g. tagging) and to access common data resources (e.g. WordNet). The infrastructure and the building blocks will be WWW-enabled, and may reside on more than one machine as needed. A server in Sheffield will provide a high quality gateway to architectural services, language engineering building blocks and data resources.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our aim, then, is to advance UK research in language processing, and enable us to preserve our leading role in the EC’s programmes, particularly at a time when developments on the Internet are driving investment in this area and have led to a number of new commercial developments. Sadly, a high proportion of the new companies and products appearing now are based in the US. Our work will contribute to easing the commercialisation of  language technologies by providing an efficient, robust and well-documented data management substrate that can be delivered as part of applications (without any of the graphical development tools that a researcher needs). One advantage that we have over the US is our proximity to multi-lingual continental Europe: our infrastructure is both language-neutral and ideally suited to minimising integration problems in multi-site projects.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Within our own research group at Sheffield, the development proposed here is intended to underlie and enable a rolling experimental programme of research in Information Extraction (where we have just attained the highest score for co-reference resolution in the MUC7 DARPA competition – see </FONT><A HREF="http://www.muc.saic.com/"><FONT SIZE=2>www.muc.saic.com</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=2>), multi-lingual text content access and summarisation, dialogue processing, word-sense disambiguation and extension, lexical storage and belief/knowledge representation.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last but not least, academics teaching computational linguistics, natural language processing and natural language engineering, and some parts of cognitive science, linguistics and modern languages can all benefit from easy-to-use graphical tools for manipulating language and language-related data structures.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Below we give comments on reviews of a previous version of this proposal, then section 1 describes our previous work in this area, and introduces the key personnel involved. Section 2 gives extensive technical detail of the work we will carry out in the project, beginning with a review of related previous work in the field (2.1) which motivates the broad stroke of our design (2.2), which is broken into three work packages. The technologies we plan to use are described (2.3). Section 3 gives planning details of the work programme, and section 4 additional relevant information for management and results exploitation. Section 5 gives references, and finally there is a Gantt chart of project packages and milestones.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT SIZE=4><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Responses to Previous Reviewers’ Comments</P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A previous version of this proposal had largely positive reviews. We respond here to negative points that were raised.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The previous proposal included substantial additional research work in Information Extraction (IE) as part of our ongoing programme in that field. This was consistent with our previous EPSRC project, but was thought inadvisable by the review panel since it made the proposal too large and too obviously separable into architecture and IE parts. We have removed that element of the work in this version, and concentrated on the architecture alone.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One reviewer questioned the viability of completing all the work specified within the time limit, using the labour requested. There are two answers to this. First, we have designed the work programme with multiple deliverables and many milestone points that represent real advances. Should we fail to complete every single part of the programme we would still have made a major contribution to the field. Secondly, we have recently completed a similar-sized project (EPSRC GR/K25267), where we have completed or exceeded the original aims of the proposal, on time and within budget. Additionally, that project began with untrained junior staff, several of whom now, after 3 years involvement with the technology underlying this proposal, form one of the most highly skilled Language Engineering development teams. We feel that there is no question that we can complete the work we propose.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was felt that we should provide more evidence of the uses to which GATE is being put – we have added to section 2.1.4 accordingly.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Doubts were expressed as to whether we have the necessary expertise for experiments on architectural support for speech processing. Dr. Steve Renals [</FONT><A HREF="#renalssap94"><FONT SIZE=2>RMB94</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=2>, </FONT><A HREF="#abbotyellowbook96"><FONT SIZE=2>RHR96</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=2>] of our Department has agreed to act as an advisor to the project in the areas of architectural requirements for supporting integrated speech and text-based NLP research. He has extensive, published, research experience on the Cambridge Abbott speech project and is a member of the EPSRC College of Computing. The NLP and Speech groups at Sheffield already collaborate extensively (e.g. on using IE for tuning language models of unknown words by identifying typical context of common unknown categories, such as names) and this proposal will continue and extend the collaboration.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One reviewer wrote that 1) the work has no scientific basis; 2) asked why not use Java?; 3) asked how will we integrate with Office environments?; 4) said it may become obsolete quickly because commercial software moves so fast; 5) said it will never run fast enough to be useful in industry; 6) said too little time has elapsed to evaluate the success of the first version; 7) said that the proposal has far too much labour allocated. Taking these in turn:</P>
<OL>

<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Not science. </I>The Council has a responsibility to Engineering and Science, and what we do, like all speech and language R&amp;D, is often more the former than the latter. The role of this architecture has been, and will be, to <I>enable</I> substantial amounts of evaluable research (and in that sense scientific) at Sheffield and elsewhere, work it will be far harder to do without such underpinning. We offer a leap forward in such UK-based work. As further evidence of this, we are at present collecting code reuse figures for projects using GATE 1, which we will publish in scientific journals (as we have all our other results, whose referees thought they had merit).</LI></P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Java? </I>We already support Java (from version 1.5), and have based our design on many of the facilities available on that platform.</LI></P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Office integration. </I>We have planned for this, but space limitations and the belief that technical details were less interesting than the design squeezed it out of the original proposal. Please see the new section <I>Technological Basis </I> (2.3). </LI></P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Obsolescence. </I>Cunningham, the designated lead RA, has spent the last 6 years developing in C++, Tcl/Tk and Java in academia, and several years before that developing in COBOL in industry, and his experience suggests that in many cases academic software moves more quickly than commercial software. In any case, we are developing tools whose utility does not depend on the vagaries of  current software fashion, but rather address research into fundamental questions of modelling human faculties using computation.</LI></P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Speed. </I>From the point of view of the developer, graphical RAD tools are always more resource hungry than applications for the end user (using MS Visual C++ on a 133Mhz Pentium with 32Mb RAM gives an example of slow-running commercial software!). From the point of view of delivering software based on the underlying data management substrate of the architecture, we fail to see how the design we have put forward (that uses conventional database software and the optimised data structures of the TIPSTER architecture committee, which included substantial commercial interests) is likely to be slow, and our reviewer gave no evidence to back up the assertion. </LI></P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Too little evaluation time.</I> It is now 18 months since the release of GATE 1.0, and we have included details of its take up and use. As noted under point 4) software moves quickly: 18 months ago Java was a little-known novelty language!</LI></P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Too much labour. </I>Another reviewer thought the programme <I>too ambitious</I> given the labour requested – see above. GATE 1 and the IE components delivered with it ran to 100,000 lines of code in 5 programming languages.  Some industrial software process planning literature assumes 10 lines of fully debugged and documented code per programmer per day, which would have meant 27 person years to produce our system (which was in fact produced, under EPSRC funding, along with numerous academic papers and competing in two MUC evaluations etc., in 9 person-years). </LI></P></OL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I</B>) The LaSIE/VIE IE system that was part of previous research to this proposal (GR/K25267) (see references above) has competed within the US ARPA TIPSTER and MUC competitions and emerged in 1995 as the best IE system outside the US at such tasks as locating proper names, events and descriptions in texts, and determining co-references between them.&nbsp; Our group has extensive associated work in grammar induction [</FONT><A HREF="#Kro94"><FONT SIZE=2>KGW94</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=2>]<B> </B>(GR/K66215): the derivation of grammar rules from corpora, which has provided the basis for grammars for LaSIE, and the stimulus for more general work on learning algorithms for adapting NLP (and particularly IE) systems to users.&nbsp; Within the EC ECRAN project we have developed lexical tuning algorithms to adapt lexicons for IE to new domains, and a corpus based method for deriving verb patterns from machine readable dictionaries<B> </B>to form the basis of another, pattern rather than grammar based, IE system within GATE (this system shares many modules with LaSIE, a form of complementary and competing development only possible within an architecture like GATE).&nbsp; We hope this year to test, independently and for the first time, the Levin-Dorr hypothesis on the relation of syntactic and semantic distribution of verbs.&nbsp; Recent experimental work has included a project on a general sense-tagger (against lexicons) [</FONT><A HREF="#Wilks96b"><FONT SIZE=2>Wil96b</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=2>], using a number of modules based on different information sources: this work is currently yielding, at 90% of all words correctly sense-resolved, the best published results world-wide on general (all-word) sense resolution, and forms a GATE module contributing to the pattern-based IE project.&nbsp; The IE technology has also provided the base for the major EC project AVENTINUS on drugs and security [Thu97], is about to be applied in PASTA, a BBSRC-EPSRC bioinformatics project (50/BIF08754) on automatic extraction of

Wilks has a long history of collaboration with major publishers involved in the production of linguistic resources; particularly Longmans (where he has been on their linguistic committee for many years) CUP, Collins and OUP.&nbsp; In New Mexico he set up the NSF-funded Consortium for Lexical Research. </P>

He was a researcher at Stanford AI Laboratory, and then Professor of Computer Science and Linguistics at the University of Essex in England, before founding the Computing Research Laboratory in New Mexico, where he proposed and managed a range of large research projects in NLP, including information extraction (TIPSTER), lexicon development and belief and knowledge structures.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An illustrative set of the sort of major &quot;use cases&quot; we expect for GATE2 would be: a dictionary publisher layers our common lexical resources model on top of their dictionary and makes it available on the WWW for limited queries with a view to encouraging researchers and generating extra sales of the unlimited version; the TIPSTER organisation (or an EU equivalent) makes its common module pool available for running remotely on their server, processing texts in databases on client machines; a supplier of information retrieval software (such as a large UK finance house) uses the interface to develop a name recognition component and uses the document manager with interface stripped to deliver the component; academics teaching language processing or language learning use the graphical facilities and rapid prototyping capabilities to structure their classes; researchers in etymology use it to collect statistics on word evolution from online newspapers, without copying all the web pages; an EC R&amp;D project uses it as the backbone for developing term substitution and name transliteration add-ins for the Han character word-processing market.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An <I>architecture</I> in this proposal is a macro-level organisational pattern for the components and data resources that make up a language processing system; development environments add graphical tools to access the services provided by the architecture.&nbsp; The GATE architecture does this using three subsystems: (1) GDM, the GATE Document Manager; (2) GGI, the GATE Graphical Interface; (3) CREOLE, a Collection of REusable Objects for Language Engineering. GDM manages the information about texts produced and consumed by NLP processes; GGI provides visual access to this data and manages control flow; CREOLE is the set of resources so far integrated with GATE. </P>

</FONT><B><FONT SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="GATE1"></A>2.1 Previous Work </P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Existing systems that provide software infrastructure for NLP can be classified as belonging to one of three types according to the way they manage information about texts: </P>

<UL>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>additive, or markup-based: </B>information produced is added to the text in the form of markup, e.g. SGML; </LI></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>referential, or annotation-based: </B>information is stored separately with references back to the original text, e.g. the TIPSTER architecture; </LI></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>abstraction-based: </B>the original text is preserved in processing only as part of an integrated data structure that represents information about the text in a uniform, theoretically-motivated, model, e.g. attribute-value structures in the ALEP system. </LI></P></UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Additive architectures</B> for managing information about text add markup to the original text at each successive phase of processing.  An architecture based on SGML has been developed at the University of Edinburgh called LT-NSL [</FONT><A HREF="#Tho96"><FONT SIZE=2>TM96</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=2>]. Tools in a LT-NSL system communicate via interfaces specified as SGML document type definitions (DTDs – essentially tag set descriptions), using character streams on pipe. To obviate the need to deal with some difficult types of SGML (e.g. minimised markup) texts are converted to a normal form before processing. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The ARPA-sponsored TIPSTER programme in the US, now in its third phase, has also produced a data-driven architecture for NLP systems [</FONT><A HREF="#Gri96b"><FONT SIZE=2>Gri96</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=2>]. Whereas in LT-NSL all information about a text is encoded in SGML, which is added by the modules, in TIPSTER a text remains unchanged while information is stored in a separate database: the <B>referential approach</B>. Information is stored in the database in the form of <I>annotations</I>, which associate arbitrary information (<I>attributes</I>), with portions of documents (identified by sets of start/end byte offsets or <I>spans</I>). Attributes may be the result of linguistic analysis, e.g. POS tags or textual unit type. In this way the information built up about a text by NLP modules is kept separate from the texts themselves. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The <B>abstraction-based </B>approach to managing information about texts is primarily motivated by theories about the nature of the information represented.&nbsp; ALEP [</FONT><A HREF="#Sch94"><FONT SIZE=2>Sch94</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=2>,</FONT><A HREF="#Sim94"><FONT SIZE=2>Sim94</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=2>], while in principle open, is primarily an advanced system for developing and manipulating feature structure knowledge-bases under unification. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.1.1 The GATE Document Manager (GDM) </P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Both the additive and referential approaches are serious candidates for the underlying architecture of an optimal infrastructure; [</FONT><A HREF="#Cun97a"><FONT SIZE=2>CHGW97b</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=2>] compares them in detail: both are&nbsp; available as standards (SGML; TIPSTER architecture) and are theory-neutral. TIPSTER has a better time/space profile, can take advantage of database technology straightforwardly, is better for random access to data (SGML is inherently sequential [</FONT><A HREF="#McK97a"><FONT SIZE=2>MBT97</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=2>]), and can represent graph-structured and non-contiguous text structures easily. For these reasons we believe that there are significant advantages to the TIPSTER model and we have chosen this for the core of the GATE Document Manager, with support for import and export of SGML using the Edinburgh tools.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.1.2 The GATE graphical interface (GGI)</B> </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the key benefits of adopting an explicit architecture for data management is that it becomes straightforward to add graphical interface access to architectural services and data visualisation tools, and such a layer is our second pillar: GGI, the GATE graphical interface. GGI has functions for creating, viewing and editing collections of documents which are managed by the GDM and that form the corpora which LE modules and systems in GATE use as input data. It also has facilities to display the results of module or system execution, i.e. new or changed annotations associated with the document. These annotations can be viewed either in raw form, using a generic annotation viewer, or in an annotation-specific way, if special annotation viewers are available. For example, named entity annotations which identify and classify proper names (e.g. organisation names, person names, location names) are shown by colour-coded highlighting of relevant words; phrase structure annotations are shown by graphical presentation of parse trees; coreference chains are shown through highlighting linked phrases.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.1.3 A developing Collection of REusable Objects for Language Engineering (CREOLE)</B> </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The third pillar of the system is the one that does all the real work of processing texts and extracting information about their content: CREOLE , a Collection of REusable Objects for Language Engineering. CREOLE is not strictly part of GATE at all, but is the set of resources currently integrated with the system. Members of this set currently include:&nbsp; the VIE English IE components (tokeniser and text structure analysers; sentence splitter; two POS taggers; morphological analyser; chart parser; name matcher; discourse interpreter); the Brill tagger; the </FONT><A HREF="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/NL/anlt.html"><FONT SIZE=2>Alvey Natural Language Tools</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=2> morphological analyser and parser; the Plink parser; the Parseval tree comparison software [</FONT><A HREF="#Har91"><FONT SIZE=2>Har91</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=2>]; the MUC scoring tools [</FONT><A HREF="#Gri96"><FONT SIZE=2>GS96</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=2>]; French parsing and morphological analysis tools from Fribourg and INRIA; Italian corpus analysis tools from Rome Tor Vergata; a wide range of </FONT><A HREF="http://www.sics.se/humle/projects/svensk/svensk.html"><FONT SIZE=2>Swedish language processing tools</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=2>. Other modules to be integrated in the near future include: the ALICE parser from UMIST; the Claws tagger from Lancaster; the neural net parser from Hertfordshire; the Cambridge/CMU statistical language modelling toolkit. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The process of integrating modules into GATE has been automated to a large degree and can be driven from the interface. The developer is required to produce some C++, Tcl or Java code that uses the GDM TIPSTER API to get information from the database and write back results. The underlying module can be in C/C++, Java or Tcl, or be an external executable written in any language (the current CREOLE set includes Prolog, Lisp and Perl programs, for example). <A NAME="GATE2"></A></P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our proposal is to extend CREOLE to cover as many core areas of language engineering R&amp;D as possible. In support of this aim, GDM and GGI will be developed in a number of significant ways, and a new subsystem, the GATE Resource Manager (GRM), added to extend control regime options and cater for integration of both algorithmic and data resources. Like other software, NLP components comprise both algorithms and data, and are&nbsp; predominantly one or the other:&nbsp; for example, a part-of-speech tagger or a parser is best distinguished by its algorithms (e.g. finite state transduction, or feature structure unification over charts); a lexicon or grammar is best described by reference to the data types and tokens it contains (rather than whatever methods are used to access it). GATE&nbsp; 1 was biased towards algorithmic resources, partly because reuse of such resources has been very low in the field, whereas reuse of data is more frequent [</FONT><A HREF="#Cun94"><FONT SIZE=2>Cun94</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=2>] (e.g. compare how many new parsers still get written each year, versus how many people use the Penn Treebank). GATE&nbsp; 2 will correct this imbalance, and provide an entirely new way of distributing and accessing NLP data resources.</P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">WP 1: The GATE2 core</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">WP 1.1: A distributed Unicode document manager: GDM 2 </P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second version of the GATE document manager will support a very wide range of human languages by adoption of the Unicode standard, and enable users to select from a variety of SQL databases (via the </FONT><A HREF="http://www.javasoft.com/"><FONT SIZE=2>JDBC</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=2> standard) and object-oriented databases, including a free version using the </FONT><A HREF="http://www.odi.com/"><FONT SIZE=2>ObjectDesign </FONT></A><FONT SIZE=2>PSE system. We will extend the current facilities for reading in SGML documents and converting their markup into TIPSTER format to a range of text types including email and RTF, and track the emerging XML standard. Documents and their components will support conversion to HTML for viewing and exporting data separately from the graphical interface. To support IR work we will implement the TIPSTER IR classes, and provide efficient lightweight document management to fit the computationally intensive processes used in this field. Finally, we will support multi-media documents by moving to a transparent representation of document content with variable indexing for different components (text, graphics, pictures, video, audio). Distributed document databases will be supported using the NMSU Computing Research Laboratory’s Java RMI document manager, the supply of which is already agreed.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">WP 1.2: A standards-based interface: GGI 2 </P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">GATE 2 will take advantage of the prevalence of object-centred graphical interfaces to provide a look-and-feel that follows de-facto standards and hence has a low learning overhead. For example, there will be object-specific management tools for all domain objects (systems, modules, collections, documents, annotations). These tools will provide tabbed views, drag and drop, flexible customisation (e.g., user-defined filters on annotations will be displayed in separate tabs). In general, the aim is to make GATE look like a desktop incorporating all these management tools, so that the user can easily manipulate systems and documents and also inspect the results associated with each document. An easy-to-learn, easy-to-use interface will increase the willingness of researchers to adopt GATE as a tool and will promote its use as a teaching tool (several users are already using GATE for teaching and there has been considerable interest expressed by colleagues at Sussex, Edinburgh and Lancaster in extending its utility for teaching). The interface will support Unicode, and will allow editable documents with automatic annotation offset recalculation (via a gap buffer). We will investigate the problem of chaining updates to annotation structures during editing. GGI will be a set of Java Beans, so developers will be able to build their own customised interfaces (see 2.1.3).</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>consolidate the algorithmic resource integration mechanisms that currently live in GGI and GDM and extend those mechanisms to support distributed tools; </LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>add integration and management mechanisms for linguistic resources such as lexicons. </LI></P></UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At present, services such as the Lexical Data Consortium, the European Language Resources Association, and the Stuttgart Registry are static servers that require the user to download source code or data and install it on their own machines. We will develop an <B>Active CREOLE Server</B> with which researchers can assemble systems from components that may be running on a mixture of their own site, the server site (Sheffield) and at others' sites. The overheads involved in integrating diverse components will then be reduced to an absolute minimum. Where sites wish to retain licensing control access can be password-based, or forwarded to a server local to the developer.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">WP 2: Reusable objects for&nbsp; NLP tasks: CREOLE 2 </P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The modules integrated into GATE are chiefly related to IE. To make the system more useful for a wider spectrum of researchers and developers&nbsp; we will integrate modules for machine translation (MT), information retrieval (IR) [</FONT><A HREF="#Strz97"><FONT SIZE=2>Strz97</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=2>], speech recognition (SR), dialogue processing and corpus linguistics and lexicography. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">MT and IR support are straightforward from the perspective of the TIPSTER architecture, but speech recognition and dialogue are more complex. Dr. Steve Renals [</FONT><A HREF="#renalssap94"><FONT SIZE=2>RMB94</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=2>, </FONT><A HREF="#abbotyellowbook96"><FONT SIZE=2>RHR96</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=2>] of the Sheffield Computer Science Department has agreed to act as an advisor to the project in the areas of architectural requirements for supporting integrated speech and text-based NLP research, and on speech sources for IE. The architecture is based on an underlying model of a sequential information source – currently text – with non-sequential (e.g. graph-structured) information associated with it. This will make extension of the current TIPSTER model of a text-based information source (which is indexed by byte offset) to an audio-based information source (which is indexed by time) reasonably straightforward. Having done this we can represent phone or word lattice structures from the speech recognisers in a fashion very similar to the HTK representation standard. To validate this work and provide examples and documentation for others to follow we will integrate the Abbot recogniser [</FONT><A HREF="#abbotyellowbook96"><FONT SIZE=2>RHR96</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=2>]. Additional issues in supporting integrated speech work within GATE are: efficiency, and the need for incremental distributed processing as evidenced by e.g. the Verbmobil ICE project (see below). GATE support for dialogue processing means support for documents comprised of dialogue turns, and interface tools for managing user input collection and system output presentation. We will make available the ViewGen system [</FONT><A HREF="#BaWi91"><FONT SIZE=2>BW91</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=2>, </FONT><A HREF="#LeWi97b"><FONT SIZE=2>LW97</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=2>, </FONT><A HREF="#LeWi96b"><FONT SIZE=2>LW96</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=2>] to exemplify the new facilities. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Corpus linguistics and lexicography tools such as [</FONT><A HREF="#Chr94"><FONT SIZE=2>Chr94</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=2>, </FONT><A HREF="#Mik97a"><FONT SIZE=2>MF97</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=2>] will be added to GATE, based on an analysis of features available in current systems and we will continue work already done with Dr Tony McEnery of Lancaster University on integrating some of his group’s corpus processing tools. The needs of grammar developers for tools such as those presented in [</FONT><A HREF="#Est97"><FONT SIZE=2>ELNP97</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=2>] will be analysed, though it seems likely that the best approach is to provide examples of integrating grammars and parsers/generators from external systems, rather than duplicating previous work. We will continue to support data interchange with text markup and learning systems such as [</FONT><A HREF="#Day97"><FONT SIZE=2>DAH97</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=2>]. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">WP 3: A new model of LE resource use and distribution </P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the most interesting developments in CREOLE will be extension of the currently process-oriented resources set to include predominantly data resources such as lexicons, ontologies and thesauri. (This package will make use of the extensions to the GATE core described in WP1.3 above.) Much progress has been made over the last decade in provision of large-scale resources of this type [</FONT><A HREF="#WilksGuthrieSlator94"><FONT SIZE=2>WGS95</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=2>], but despite various standards initiatives, there are still barriers to data resource reuse: </P>

<UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>each resource has its own representation syntax and corresponding access mode: relational databases in the case of CELEX, a custom C API or Prolog representation in Wordnet, SGML in the case of the British National Corpus; </LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>resources must be installed locally to be usable (and precisely how this happens, what operating systems are supported etc., varies from site to site). </LI></P></UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The consequences of the first bullet are that although linguistic resources normally share some structure in common (e.g. at the most obvious level, lexicons are organised around words and word strings) this commonality is wasted when using a new resource, since the developer has to learn everything afresh each time, and&nbsp; work which seeks to investigate or exploit commonalities between resources (e.g. to link several lexicons to an ontology) has first to build a layer of access routines on top of each resource. So, for example, if we wish to do task-based evaluation of lexicons by measuring the relative performance of an information extraction system with different instantiations of the lexical resource, we might end up writing code to translate several different resources into SQL or SGML. The consequence of the second bullet above is that there is no way to "try before you buy": no way to examine a data resource for its suitability for your needs before licensing it. Correspondingly, there is no way for a resource provider to give limited access to their products for advertising purposes, nor gain revenue through piecemeal supply of sections of a resource. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some would argue that the solution is to map all resources into SGML, but experience using the BNC suggests otherwise: to get the best out of it &quot;you have to be an SGML guru&quot; (Tony McEnery, Lancaster). Using databases would also seem an obvious solution (and one supported by the extensive experience of Sheffield with GATE 1, the TIPSTER architecture committee, and the Lancaster University group), but the relational paradigm is also problematic, requiring the representation of the data in cross-referenced table form. As McEnery has also pointed out, using object-oriented database (OODB) technology should resolve this problem. In an OODB the data is represented in a form very close to its original structure using inheritance and containment. We will develop a common programmatic model of the various resources types, implemented in CORBA IDL and/or Java, along with a distributed server for non-local access, and distribute the code required to map them into this model. This model will for the first time provide the research community with a unified means for accessing linguistic resources. The model will be documented in HTML using JavaDoc, </FONT><A HREF="http://www.rational.com/"><FONT SIZE=2>Rational</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=2> ROSE and SODA. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The common model of language data resources we propose would be a set of inheritance hierarchies making up a forest or set of graphs. At the top of the hierarchies would be very general abstractions from resources (e.g. a thesarus groups synonyms); at the leaves would be data items that were specific to individual resources (e.g. WordNet synsets have glosses). Program access would be available at all levels, allowing the developer to select an appropriate level of commonality for each application. Note that, although an exciting element of the work would be to provide algorithms dynamically to link common resources e.g. connecting EuroWordNet to LDOCE, this proposal&nbsp; is not to develop new, but simply to improve access to existing, resources. Notice, also, that it is a proposal about language data quite separate from, though compatible with, the lexical data compression ideas in recent DATR work [</FONT><A HREF="#eg96"><FONT SIZE=2>EG96</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=2>]. This is NOT in any way a new standards initiative, but a way to build on previous initiatives.  The issues of standards is a vexed one: experience with repositories of lexical materials (e.g. the CRL Consortium for Lexical Research 1989-93) suggested that if resources had to have standardised formats, they are not deposited or used. The success of WordNet world-wide is a demonstration of how researcher choice can defy any committee's standards. What we propose here is quite different from projects like SEAL [Eva97, KE95] that attempt to conflate different lexical resources: in what we propose, the resources retain their integrity, or &quot;native&quot;' structure. We propose, via an object oriented methodology, a standardised taxonomy and structure only as an index to the links between lexical objects with the same function in the various resources. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><B><FONT SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.3 Technological Basis </P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most of this proposal can be viewed as an extended requirements analysis and high-level design for a long-term infrastructure for language work. Low-level design would be inappropriate at this stage. However, it would also be foolhardy to embark on this type of software development without an idea of the technological risks involved (see e.g. the section on process in [Fow97] for good arguments for doing technology identification an early stage). This section sketches the key technologies we provisionally plan to use for our implementation.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To support the kinds of usage scenarios outlined at the start of section 2, GATE 2 will: be distributed (programs and data may live on several machines); have a flexible graphical interface that displays a wide range of language-oriented data structures; have an efficient underlying data management substrate that is easily extensible to a wide range of existing databases (probably via the JDBC Java—SQL mapping); 16-bit clean Unicode-enabled; be WWW capable, and probably integrated with popular word processing tools like MSWord. To meet these key requirements, GATE 2 will be implemented primarily in the Java language (</FONT><A HREF="http://java.sun.com/"><FONT SIZE=2>java.sun.com</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=2>). Distributed computing  will be implemented using Java RMI (Remote Method Invocation), which is a light-weight alternative to the complexities of CORBA (for more discussion of distribution in NLP see [</FONT><A HREF="#Zaj97b"><FONT SIZE=2>Zaj97b</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=2>]). The new Java Beans component model will be used to achieve flexibility – developers will be able to recombine our components for other applications as they wish – and this will also, via MSJ++, give us access to the COM data sharing model underlying WinWord’s new integration mechanisms. The interface will be implemented using the mature model-view-controller architecture handed down from e.g. Smalltalk and now available in e.g. Borland JBuilder and JDK1.2. Backwards-compatibility with GATE 1 will be achieved via the Java Native Interface, which we have used to integrate a simple Java document manager in GATE version 1.5. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This technology is new, but we have run preliminary experiments with each part of the jigsaw, and are confident of the feasibility of this implementation route.</P>

</B><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The following sections list the milestone objectives in each work package. The project plan is of modular design incorporating comprehensive measurement points. The software team at Sheffield (whose members will lead and advise the project) has an established development process based on iterating cycles of design, implementation, deployment and testing. Each item in the lists below represents a use-case or external requirement on the system, and will be the subject of one or more iterations, which will result in delivered components. Thus testing and integration of new subsystems is distributed across the project, with the advantage that progress can be realistically appraised continuously, and remedial action taken against schedule or quality slippage. Small group software engineering is not well catered for by many mainstream development methods, but our group has several person-decades experience in this type of environment, and our method exploits the core of modern thinking on object oriented and explicit process development.

</FONT><B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4. Additional Issues</P></B>
<FONT SIZE=2><B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.1 Scientific/Technological Relevance</P>
</B></FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Each work package proposed makes advances in Language Engineering (LE)  technology and facilitates further advances by the UK R&amp;D Community.  The GATE2 NLP architecture is itself novel, and we hope the best available world-wide; the integrated modules we provide will be a rich and novel platform for experimental and technological advance throughout the community, including our own (Sheffield) programme in LE and computational linguistics.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.2  Relevance to Beneficiaries</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The value of GATE1 to a wide range of R&amp;D groups has already been demonstrated, and GATE2 will advance that standard, helping keep UK work in the front line without the need for direct participation in US competitions, useful as that is.  GATE2 will assist system developers both in research and in any branch of the language industries (especially electronic publishing and news dissemination), speeding the integration of functionalities and their testing. This will be evaluated and tested with our collaborators (see attached letters of support).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.3  Dissemination and Exploitation</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Apart from the standard academic dissemination channels of conferences and journal/book publication (including web and archive publication), we shall continue with specialised workshops, both those we shall organise ourselves, and those we have in the past been invited to join, such as DTI/EPSRC sponsored industrial forums and the Unicom seminar series for industry. GATE is already widely disseminated, and it seems likely at the time of writing that US&nbsp;DARPA may make it an interim NLP architecture standard, which would entrench its R&amp;D position world wide; it has also been used as the basis of a range of EU language engineering projects.  We shall continue to publicise it, though without offering maintenance, and will set up a user group and some form of industrially orientated workshop/forum for GATE users, and those interested, during the first year of the project.  We have considerable experience in organising workshops of this sort.  For both GATE and the IE system, we shall maintain our direct links with US and EU standards-setting bodies, continuing to argue that standards are vital but must be based on systems that are widely acceptable to users. We also participate in ELSE, the EU NLP evolution standards project, and hope to make GATE2 the platform for Europe-wide evaluation in NLP, thus linking EU and US activities to the overall benefit of the UK position as a fulcrum in the field.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have a developed set of web pages advertising aspects of GATE and our IE work, through our department and through ILASH and we also maintain the linked CLUK and ICCL web sites.  We also produce industrially-orientated publicity materials, and receive industrial solicitations as a result of these (and actively solicit others from relevant firms). With them we seek to spread a culture of adapting/customising LE systems to particular industrial requirements.  A key feature of the current proposal is that we shall set up a publicly available WWW&nbsp;demo of GATE 2, with as many modalities as proves feasible.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.4  Management</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The project will be managed by a team led by Yorick Wilks as principal investigator: Rob Gaizauskas will manage requirements capture and Hamish Cunningham system development.  Wilks has managed large NLP projects for UK and US agencies, and NLP architecture projects since the beginning of the US TIPSTER project; he was the PI of GATE1. Gaizauskas is widely experienced from the Sussex POETIC project and has designed most of the EPSRC-supported LaSIE system. Cunningham has gained extensive experience with the implementation and deployment of GATE1 and its use in major EU projects. The Sheffield ILASH/CS NLP group has a tight and experienced management structure with its own research coordinator, systems administrator and secretary who ensure delivery of modules, conformance to reporting and delivery deadlines, the archiving of software and the organisation of workshops and related events.  The NLP group maintains a seminar series and a set of linked study groups to keep abreast of the literature and to train its research students.  The group maintains its own monthly newsletter that also sets out deadlines and milestones: each research project also has its own weekly meeting reporting to the NLP group weekly meeting.  We hold regular and frequent meetings with industrial collaborators, whom we also invite to join our departmental Industrial Associates Group.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.5  Manpower and Equipment</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposal requests two RAs: Hamish Cunningham, with substantial engineering experience to lead GATE2 development and module integration, and one junior RA to program on GATE2.  Each of these would be fully committed. Each would require a state of the art workstation, since we have no other source for these (our industrial collaborators not being hardware manufacturers), and we also need hardware to support the Active CREOLE Server.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.6  Travel</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The travel budget represents normal participation at a subset of major conferences to disseminate results (IJCAI, ECAI, AISB, ACL, COLING) with some provision for participation in DARPA events (like MUC) since they are essential if we are to remain a focal part of the international community by participating in the DARPA steering committee.</P>
